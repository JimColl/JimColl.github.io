  &lt;div&gt;
    This is a living document.  Changes will be announced in class.  The main course page syllabus supersedes this one in all cases.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-description&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course provides an introduction to computer based analysis of spatial data.  Topics covered include the fundamentals of geospatial thought, basic principles of collecting, storing, analyzing, and displaying spatial data, and cursory treatment of analysis and decision making.  Emphasis is on problem solving activities using common spatial analytical techniques using typical applications as examples. The student will gain extensive hands on experience with state of the art GIS software in the lab. This course introduces the concepts and components of a geographic information system (GIS). It also teaches the essential skills of operating a functional GIS through the use of the ArcGIS software suite. By completing this course, students will understand the operational processes of spatial data acquisition, editing in ArcGIS Desktop with QA/QC, metadata development, geodatabase design, spatial query and display, spatial analysis and modeling, preliminary GIS application development, cartographic mapping and dynamic visualization, and GIS implementation basics. Students will also be exposed to Google Earth and common Free and  Open Source Software (FOSS) tools, as well as the basic concepts of remote sensing and Global Positioning System (GPS). GIS technology has broad applications in natural and social sciences, humanities, environmental studies, engineering, and management. Examples include wildlife habitat study, urban and regional planning, contagious disease monitoring, agriculture and forestry, environmental quality assessment, emergency management, transportation planning, consumer and competitor analysis, and many more. This course will introduce a few selected use cases of GIS application in different disciplines.  Finally, this class counts towards the &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalog.ku.edu/liberal-arts-sciences/geography/geographic-information-science-ucert/&#34;&gt;Undergraduate certificate in GIS&lt;/a&gt;.  I obviously recommend it, particularly if you intend to pursue GIS as a career path/toolset in any capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-responsibilities&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is student’s responsibility to attend the lectures, do the readings, and finish lab assignments. All students should be prepared to participate in class discussion and answer questions when called upon.  All students are expected to complete labs and exams on time. Labs are due at the beginning of the lab period one week after they are assigned, unless otherwise noted. Detailed lab rules will be given by the teaching assistant in the first lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expectations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attend every Class/lab and &lt;strong&gt;ask questions!&lt;/strong&gt; At times, the ArcGIS software can be very unforgiving, and GIS can seem like a foreign language. The last thing I want is for you to walk out of this class without understanding the material. I expect and hope that this will be a rewarding experience for everyone. We are available to answer questions and otherwise offer assistance during the office hours indicated above or by appointment.  Additionally, if you have any questions, feel free to drop me an e-mail or use the slack channel (The link will be passed around on the sign up sheet at the beginning of the year). I try to be diligent about responding to emails and by using slack you are likely to get a very rapid response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;computers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computers in the lab are not cheap to replace. Please do your part to lengthen their lives by not spilling coffee/soda/liquids of any kind on the computer or any of its parts. You do NOT need to go out and purchase a computer for this class, although I do recommend having a personal computer with ArcGIS installed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer recommendations:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ArcGIS is a demanding program, and a lower grade computer is not recommended.  If you are at KU, IT offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuit.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011590&#34;&gt;virtualLabs&lt;/a&gt;, a remote desktop program you can use to access ArcMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to purchase a computer, I offer these general guidelines. You should aim for a 64-bit computer (x64), and aside from that I like to prioritize CPU &amp;amp; RAM &amp;gt; video &amp;amp; hard drive speed &amp;gt; hard drive space (External hard drives are really cheap, and as long as the computer has a USB port you are good to go).  For the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve deferred to the pre-built pc choices on &lt;a href=&#34;https://buildmypc.net/&#34;&gt;https://buildmypc.net/&lt;/a&gt;.
In general, I tend to stay away from the &amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo; laptops.  For those prices, you can build a much more powerful desktop and get a lot more mileage out of it, but that&amp;rsquo;s just me.  If you want to go that route however virtually all will meet your school related needs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JColl/saved/#view=zddq3C&#34;&gt;My “Ideal” build (This is excessive, visualization grade)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab is open for students whenever there is no scheduled class (see the calendar posted on the lab door. Additionally, ArcMap is available in the GIS lab on the second floor of Watson Library, and on the Architecture and Engineering computers if you have access to those. A sign up sheet will also be passed around at the beginning of the semester for those who wish to install ArcGIS on your own personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic-integrity&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Integrity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, cheating and/or plagiarism &lt;strong&gt;is not tolerated&lt;/strong&gt;. Feel free to discuss the labs with your classmates, but all work you turn in should be your own, and it&amp;rsquo;s insert year here, how hard is it to give someone credit for their work?  As a graduate student, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/&#34;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; for my citation needs, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citethisforme.com/us/citation-generator&#34;&gt;Cite This for Me&lt;/a&gt; will also work for you in a pinch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disabilities&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disabilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has a disability that may prevent full demonstration of academic ability should contact me as soon as possible to ensure accommodations can be made to allow for full educational benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-labs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Labs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a cartography course; however, the final product of the majority of the labs is a map (or maps) of some sort. The grade you receive on the maps will be based primarily on the results of the relevant analysis, not cartographic technique (there is a whole class dedicated to this; GEOG 211). That said, some level of cartographic knowledge will be useful to effectively communicate with maps, and will be stressed in critiques of your submissions. As the semester wears on we expect improvements and may begin taking points off for excessively bad cartographic technique. Please refer to the cartography resources linked below for some basic guidelines or ask for feedback.  In addition, each lab will specify the steps to follow with regards to what to submit for grading and how to do so. Please don’t make assumptions. Follow these instructions carefully; failure to submit the correct files or submission of files in an incorrect fashion will result in drastic loss of points. Don’t turn a potential A into an F due to failure to follow directions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-evaluation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course grade will be evaluated based on two exams, ten lab exercises, and a final project.
The exams will include materials from the textbooks, lecture slides, handouts, and labs. Mid-term
exam will cover the materials from the first half of the class, and the final exam will focus on the
second half. The final exam is not comprehensive, but since we will be building on concepts
throughout the semester, materials from the first half of the semester will inevitably be part of the
final exam. A breakdown of grade weights is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Midterm exam 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final exam 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labs 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Project 20%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade will be on a straight scale, not on a curve. If you all do well, you will all get
an A. Letter grades will be determined based on the standard grading scale. Each student will
complete a final project. The project will be presented to the class during the last two weeks of
class. Details on the final project can be found in the final project handout. Letter grades will be
determined based on the following grading scale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;A+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;A&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;A-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;B+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;B-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;C+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;C&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;C-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;D+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;D&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;D-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;F&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;100 - 97&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;96 - 93&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;92 - 90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;89 - 87&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;86 - 83&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;82 - 80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;79 - 77&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;76 - 73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;72 - 70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;69 - 67&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;66 - 63&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;62 - 60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-responsibilities-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is student’s responsibility to attend the lectures, do the readings, and finish lab assignments.  All students should be prepared to participate in class discussion and answer questions when called upon. All students are expected to complete labs and exams on time. Labs are due at the beginning of the lab period one week after they are assigned, unless otherwise noted. Detailed lab rules will be given by the teaching assistant in the first lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exams&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-term exam will cover the materials from the first half of the class, and the final exam will focus on the second half. The final exam is not comprehensive, but since we will be building on concepts throughout the semester, materials from the first half of the semester will inevitably be part of the final exam.  &lt;del&gt;Either exam may include a practical portion.  This practical portion will consist of instructions to prepare some sort of short analysis or demonstration of practical knowledge related to the use of ArcGIS.  These will be posted either a week before the exam and due on the date of the exam, or posted the day of the exam and due a week after.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    These labs are largely written for ArcMap 10.6.  However, operations from ArcMap 10.2 through 10.6 and even up to Pro all largely look the same although some of the tools may have shifted or changed names just to keep you on your toes.  Although these labs are written so that you can follow them step by step, I expect you to flex those critical thinking skills of yours.  Take a step back, read the learning objectives and ask yourself what steps are needed to get to that goal.  When in doubt, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmgtfy.com/&#34;&gt;Google it&lt;/a&gt;!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-1-a-survey-of-data-and-mapping-technologies-and-database-building&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 1: A survey of data and mapping technologies and database building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this lab requires writing a survey of the data and mapping technologies in the field that you are interested in (wildlife reserve, conservation, urban planning, forest resources, natural hazards, business, etc.), not limited to the data and mapping technologies covered in the lecture. This survey may include both traditional and new emerging datasets and/or mapping technologies that are used in the fields. The second part of the lab will download imagery and create a database that will be used for the next few labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-submit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit the paper outlined in part 1, and the screenshot of the data you downloaded in part 2 to blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-70-points-a-survey-of-data-and-mapping-technologies&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1 (70 points): A survey of data and mapping technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will write a survey on the data and mapping technologies in a field that you are interested in. The survey should have 2-4 single spaced pages using a font size of 12 points. Reference style should follow one of the GIS journal reference styles (e.g. Transactions in GIS, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, International Journal of Geographic Information Science, The Geographical Journal, and Computers &amp;amp; Geosciences, etc.). I also point you to several resources for reference management software &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/classoutline/#academic-integrity&#34;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading for the survey is based on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(80%) Quality of the content: how many potential datasets and mapping methods are included; How you organize your contents. Whether the length of survey is proper, and has a proper level of synthesis and details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(20%) Format: follow the requirements described above and check your grammar, spelling and sentence structures before you submit the survey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-2-30-points-building-a-database&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2 (30 points): Building a database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use these datasets for the next several labs. While we could download that datasets in each lab, the process can become time consuming so we will create a database in this lab.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will use USGS Earth Explorer to download the requisite datasets, including Landsat scenes and elevation data.&lt;br /&gt;
Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/&#34;&gt;https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/&lt;/a&gt; and log in (create an account as necessary).  While we are at this, you will also need an account at &lt;a href=&#34;https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov//&#34;&gt;https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov//&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We first need to define our area of interest.  Under the Search Criteria tab change the coordinate box to decimal degrees and copy paste the following…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latitude: -9.397055203542507&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longitude: -77.38027425750124&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Under the Data Sets tab, search for &lt;a href=&#34;https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/measures/measures_products_table/srtmgl1_v003&#34;&gt;NASA SRTM3 SRTMGL-1&lt;/a&gt; and check the box next to it.  Click results and then download the standard format.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next we need the Landsat scenes.  Our goal is to recreate some of the analysis found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00210/full&#34;&gt;Frey et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;, specifically Figure 2.  We will simplify this somewhat by starting at 1995 and looking forward in time every 2 years.  To do this go back to Search Criteria and set the Date Range dates to 06/01/1995 and 08/01/1995 respectively.
&lt;li&gt;Under the Data Sets tab, navigate to the Landsat &amp;gt; Landsat Collection 1 Level 1 check &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-landsat-archives-landsat-4-5-thematic-mapper-tm-level-1-data?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects&#34;&gt;Landsat 4-5 TM C1 Level-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Additional Criteria, set the Land Cloud Cover to less than 10%&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Results, when the images load in you can explore them with the “Show Browser Overlay” button, and download the desired tiles (Get the Level-1 GeoTIFF data products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this for every two years up to 2009 (change the Date Range on the Search Criteria tab).  The images I selected for this analysis were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;YEAR&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;SCENE NAME&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1995&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_19950622_20170109_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1997&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_19970729_20161230_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_19990601_20161217_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_20010622_20161210_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2003&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_20030714_20161205_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2005&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_20050703_20161126_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2007&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_20070725_20161112_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2009&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_20090628_20161024_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some sort of file management system is preferable to nothing.  Time wasted looking for files can be better spent performing the analysis, other research, or discovering new music.  Below I will outline what I use, but if you already have a system that works for you feel free to deviate.  Just as an aside, avoid file names with spaces or leading numbers.
&lt;li&gt;On OneDrive, create a folder for classes, in that one for this class (GEOG558), and in that folder create one for labs.  In that folder create one for Lab01, and one for base data (BaseData).  In that create folders, one called Elevation and the other called Landsat.  The Landsat tiles can get a little messy so I create extra folders underneath the Landsat folder titled something along the lines of LS05_YYYY.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unzip (Right click &amp;gt; 7-Zip &amp;gt; Extract to “FileNameHere”) the SRTMGL folder and move the HGT file (a fancy tif for SRTM data) into the elevation folder.
&lt;li&gt;The Landsat tiles are downloaded with extensions .tar.gz, they’ve essentially been compressed twice.  Unzip them the first time, open them up and unzip them a second time.  Copy all the files into their respective folders.
&lt;li&gt;Open up ArcMap and the ArcCatalog window, connect to the lab folder, and expand the BaseData file tree out a bit.  Submit a screenshot of your final files (similar to the one below).  We will use these data in the next couple of labs and I will not wait for you to download them next week so be prepared to have them ready.

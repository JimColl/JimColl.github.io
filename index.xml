&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    This is a living document.  Changes will be announced in class.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-description&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This course provides an introduction to computer based analysis of spatial data.  Topics covered include the fundamentals of geospatial thought, basic principles of collecting, storing, analyzing, and displaying spatial data, and cursory treatment of analysis and decision making.  Emphasis is on problem solving activities using common spatial analytical techniques using typical applications as examples. The student will gain extensive hands on experience with state of the art GIS software in the lab. This course introduces the concepts and components of a geographic information system (GIS). It also teaches the essential skills of operating a functional GIS through the use of the ArcGIS software suite. By completing this course, students will understand the operational processes of spatial data acquisition, editing in ArcGIS Desktop with QA/QC, metadata development, geodatabase design, spatial query and display, spatial analysis and modeling, preliminary GIS application development, cartographic mapping and dynamic visualization, and GIS implementation basics. Students will also be exposed to Google Earth and common Free and  Open Source Software (FOSS) tools, as well as the basic concepts of remote sensing and Global Positioning System (GPS). GIS technology has broad applications in natural and social sciences, humanities, environmental studies, engineering, and management. Examples include wildlife habitat study, urban and regional planning, contagious disease monitoring, agriculture and forestry, environmental quality assessment, emergency management, transportation planning, consumer and competitor analysis, and many more. This course will introduce a few selected use cases of GIS application in different disciplines.  Finally, this class counts towards the &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalog.ku.edu/liberal-arts-sciences/geography/geographic-information-science-ucert/&#34;&gt;Undergraduate certificate in GIS&lt;/a&gt;.  I obviously recommend it, particularly if you intend to pursue GIS as a career path/toolset in any capacity .&lt;br/&gt;
Satisfies: Lab and Field Experiences (LFE), Natural Science (N)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;student-responsibilities&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is student’s responsibility to attend the lectures, do the readings, and finish lab assignments. All students should be prepared to participate in class discussion and answer questions when called upon.  All students are expected to complete labs and exams on time. Labs are due at the beginning of the lab period one week after they are assigned, unless otherwise noted. Detailed lab rules will be given by the teaching assistant in the first lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expectations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attend every Class/lab and &lt;strong&gt;ask questions!&lt;/strong&gt; At times, the ArcGIS software can be very unforgiving, and GIS can seem like a foreign language. The last thing I want is for you to walk out of this class without understanding the material. I expect and hope that this will be a rewarding experience for everyone. We are available to answer questions and otherwise offer assistance during the office hours indicated above or by appointment.  Additionally, if you have any questions, feel free to drop me an e-mail or use the slack channel (The link will be passed around on the signup sheet at the beginning of the year). I try to be diligent about responding to emails and by using slack you are likely to get a very rapid response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;computers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computers in the lab are not cheap to replace. Please do your part to lengthen their lives by not spilling coffee/soda/liquids of any kind on the computer or any of its parts. You do NOT need to go out and purchase a computer for this class, although I do recommend having a personal computer with ArcGIS installed…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer recommendations:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ArcGIS is a demanding program, and a lower grade computer is not recommended.  If you are at KU, IT offers &lt;a href=&#34;https://kuit.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0011590&#34;&gt;virtualLabs&lt;/a&gt;, a remote desktop program you can use to access ArcMap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to purchase a computer, I offer these general guidelines. You should aim for a 64-bit computer (x64), and aside from that I like to prioritize CPU &amp;amp; RAM &amp;gt; video &amp;amp; hard drive speed &amp;gt; hard drive space (External hard drives are really cheap, and as long as the computer has a USB port you are good to go).  For the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve deferred to the pre-built pc choices on &lt;a href=&#34;https://buildmypc.net/&#34;&gt;https://buildmypc.net/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://pcpartpicker.com/&#34;&gt;https://pcpartpicker.com/&lt;/a&gt;.
In general, I tend to stay away from the &amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo; laptops.  For those prices, you can build a much more powerful desktop and get a lot more mileage out of it, but that&amp;rsquo;s just me.  If you want to go that route however virtually all will meet your school related needs.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pcpartpicker.com/user/JColl/saved/#view=zddq3C&#34;&gt;My “Ideal” build (This is excessive, visualization grade)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab is open for students whenever there is no scheduled class (see the calendar posted on the lab door. Additionally, ArcMap is available in the GIS lab on the second floor of Watson Library, and on the Architecture and Engineering computers if you have access to those. A signup sheet will also be passed around at the beginning of the semester for those who wish to install ArcGIS on your own personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;academic-integrity&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Integrity:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply put, cheating and/or plagiarism &lt;strong&gt;is not tolerated&lt;/strong&gt;. Feel free to discuss the labs with your classmates, but all work you turn in should be your own, and it&amp;rsquo;s insert year here, how hard is it to give someone credit for their work?  I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zotero.org/&#34;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; for my citation needs, as a KU student you have access to Endnote through &lt;a href=&#34;https://technology.ku.edu/software/microsoft-office&#34;&gt;Office 365&lt;/a&gt;, and in a pinch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citethisforme.com/us/citation-generator&#34;&gt;Cite This for Me&lt;/a&gt; will also work for you in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;disabilities&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disabilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has a disability that may prevent full demonstration of academic ability should contact me as soon as possible to ensure accommodations can be made to allow for full educational benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-the-labs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Labs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a cartography course; however, the final product of the majority of the labs is a map (or maps) of some sort. The grade you receive on the maps will be based primarily on the results of the relevant analysis, not cartographic technique (there is a whole class dedicated to this; GEOG 211). That said, some level of cartographic knowledge will be useful to effectively communicate with maps, and will be stressed in critiques of your submissions. As the semester wears on we expect improvements and may begin taking points off for excessively bad cartographic technique. Please refer to the cartography resources linked below for some basic guidelines or ask for feedback.  In addition, each lab will specify the steps to follow with regards to what to submit for grading and how to do so. Please don’t make assumptions. Follow these instructions carefully; failure to submit the correct files or submission of files in an incorrect fashion will result in drastic loss of points. Don’t turn a potential A into an F due to failure to follow directions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;cartography-primers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cartography primers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://frew.eri.ucsb.edu/private/ESM263/week/2/ESM-263-2017-02-Cartography_Basics.pdf&#34;&gt;https://frew.eri.ucsb.edu/private/ESM263/week/2/ESM-263-2017-02-Cartography_Basics.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-evaluation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Evaluation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course grade will be evaluated based on two exams, pre-class review questions, ~ten lab exercises, and a final project. The exams will include materials from the textbooks, lecture slides, handouts, and labs. A breakdown of grade weights is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exams (17.5% * 2)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-class review 5%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labs 40%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final Project 20%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final grade will be on a straight scale, not on a curve. If you all do well, you will all get an A. Let’s not find out what the alternative is. Letter grades will be determined based on the standard grading scale. Each student will complete a final project. The project will be presented to the class during the last two weeks of class. Details on the final project can be found in the final project handout. Letter grades will be determined based on the following grading scale:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;A+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;A&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;A-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;B+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;B&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;B-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;C+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;C&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;C-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;D+&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;D&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;D-&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;F&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;100 - 97&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;96 - 93&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;92 - 90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;89 - 87&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;86 - 83&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;82 - 80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;79 - 77&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;76 - 73&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;72 - 70&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;69 - 67&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;66 - 63&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;62 - 60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exams&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-term exam will cover the materials from the first half of the class, and the final exam will focus on the second half. The final exam is not comprehensive, but since we will be building on concepts throughout the semester, materials from the first half of the semester will inevitably be part of the final exam.  Either exam may include a practical portion.  This practical portion will consist of instructions to prepare some sort of short analysis or demonstration of practical knowledge related to the use of ArcGIS.  These will be posted either a week before the exam and due on the date of the exam, or posted the day of the exam and due a week after.&lt;/p&gt;

    This is a living document.  Changes will be announced in class.  The main course page syllabus supersedes this one in all cases.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;course-description&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Course Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building on the introductory GIS class, this course focuses primarily on teaching advanced spatial analysis methods with applications in the mapping of surface water and the analysis of water related environmental issues. Major topics covered include map algebra (also called cartographic modeling), multi-criteria evaluation, terrain analysis, spatial statistics, and spatial interpolation. An additional objective of the course is to have students become familiar with various methods and tools through the use of GIS software.  Continuing with the industry standard GIS software, this class expands on GIS platforms through the use of the ArcGIS software suite. Finally, this class counts towards the &lt;a href=&#34;https://catalog.ku.edu/liberal-arts-sciences/geography/geographic-information-science-ucert/&#34;&gt;certificate in GIS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;exams&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mid-term exam will cover the materials from the first half of the class, and the final exam will focus on the second half. The final exam is not comprehensive, but since we will be building on concepts throughout the semester, materials from the first half of the semester will inevitably be part of the final exam.  &lt;del&gt;Either exam may include a practical portion.  This practical portion will consist of instructions to prepare some sort of short analysis or demonstration of practical knowledge related to the use of ArcGIS.  These will be posted either a week before the exam and due on the date of the exam, or posted the day of the exam and due a week after.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;creating-a-website&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    There are a lot of links in here, to highlight some key resources I used while I was learning how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;https://gohugo.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-www&#34;&gt;https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-www&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of this website was spurred by a desire to streamline my digital footprint and more easily facilitate sharing of resources (Google Drive simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it here, and OneDrive is a whole different beast).  However, the creation of one is not as straightforward or accessible as it otherwise could be.  Somehow among the vast sea of ways to design and host a website, I found workable solution to this in the form of the HUGO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;HUGO&lt;/a&gt;, a variation of the GO programming language, is touted as “The world’s fastest framework for building websites”.  The HUGO documentation, particularly the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/&#34;&gt;hosting on github page&lt;/a&gt;, is a great place to start and is the “correct” way to go about creating a site.  Below I will walk through how I managed to get it to work, your mileage may vary.  The following will will walk you through how this website was created.  &lt;strong&gt;I also recommend following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/&#34;&gt;Academic theme instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    A cautionary note:&lt;br /&gt;
Your site doesn’t have to look like mine, feel free to pick any off the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;themes page&lt;/a&gt;.  The theme you choose will do most of the heavy lifting, and hopefully you find one that does everything you want it to.  If not, be prepared to spend a few days figuring out how HUGO and the themes work; there is no shortcut to creating new site behavior and I found it to be a bit unforgiving at times.  In short, unless you REALLY want to sink time into this skillset, pick a theme and be happy with it 😊
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;step-by-step-instructions&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Step by step&amp;rdquo; instructions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-github-account&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a github account:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;Github account&lt;/a&gt;.  I suppose in an ideal world your website name would be the same as your github Username, but these can mismatch.  I believe a free user account is restricted to one web page per account, and I haven’t bothered to see if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-git-for-windows&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install git for windows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow download and installation instructions at &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitforwindows.org/&#34;&gt;https://gitforwindows.org/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-the-website-url-repository&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the website url repository:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is possible to buy a domain so that you can customize your url, but in my case I’m cheap, and jimcoll.github.io is perfectly fine with me.  Note that here I deviate from the HUGO docs.  I don&amp;rsquo;t use github the right way, and I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a reason to use another github repository to keep the site files, as you&amp;rsquo;ll see below I just keep them on OneDrive and kept on my local hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-website-folder&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a website folder:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we need to create a folder where our website will live.  This folder ideally shouldn’t be moved after you’ve created it, so place it somewhere useful (read: not the desktop).  I gave into our digital overlords and moved most of my footprint to the cloud (OneDrive), so on my root folder I created a folder called myWebsite.  Then I like to right click on the folder and select the “Always keep it on this device”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-hugo&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing HUGO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next you need to install HUGO in the website directory.  Download the appropriate windows install from the HUGO releases (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases&lt;/a&gt;).  Unzip the file and place the hugo.exe file into your myWebsite folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-the-website&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you need to start thinking for yourself.  This process varies depending on which theme you end up choosing.  Here I’ll just point you to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/front-matter/&#34;&gt;Academic pages&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-www/tree/master/content/en/docs&#34;&gt;raw doc files&lt;/a&gt; are also useful for formatting guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updating-your-website&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating your website:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;manage your content&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easiest to test it locally first.  Shift-right click in the myWebsite folder and “Open PowerShell window here”.  Then, type &lt;code&gt;.\hugo server --disableFastRender&lt;/code&gt;.  You can then open a browser and go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/&#34;&gt;http://localhost:1313/&lt;/a&gt;.  At this point, any changes made to your site will automagically change.  When you are happy with your changes, you generate your site with the &lt;code&gt;.\hugo&lt;/code&gt; command.  This repopulates the public folder.  The last step is to push your new changes up to the repository, which you can do by right clicking in the public folder and selecting Git GUI Here, then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage Changed files&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create a commit message&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit the changes, and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the changes up to the repository.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/random/media/GitPushCommands.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-this-site-was-created&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How this site was created:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is a smashup of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/darshanbaral/aafu&#34;&gt;aafu&lt;/a&gt; and Academic themes.  Although the Academic theme has just about every field you might need, I fell in love with the AAFU theme and the accordion effect and was too enthralled not to try and integrate.  To do this, you need to understand a little about how HUGO creates a website.  HUGO uses a tiered folder system to generate the site, and will look in folders following a defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/&#34;&gt;lookup order&lt;/a&gt;.  Therefore, we need to overwrite the academic home page theme with the aafu theme.  To do this, I first install the Academic theme, and then replace the partials folder with the aafu theme.  The last step is to reconfigure the &lt;i&gt;config/_default/&lt;/i&gt; folder with the aafu theme markdown files.  Most of these are straightforward, but within the &lt;i&gt;config/_default/config.toml&lt;/i&gt;, we need to set the theme order as follows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;# Configuration of Academic
# Documentation: https://sourcethemes.com/academic/
#
# This file is formatted using TOML syntax - learn more at https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/toml/
# Each configuration section is defined by a name in square brackets (e.g. `[outputs]`).

# Title of your site
title = &amp;quot;Jim Coll&amp;quot;

# The URL of your site.
# End your URL with a `/` trailing slash, e.g. `https://example.com/`.
baseurl = &amp;quot;https://jimcoll.github.io/&amp;quot;

# Enter a copyright notice to display in the site footer.
# To display a copyright symbol, type `&amp;amp;copy;`. For current year, type `{year}`.
copyright = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

# Enable analytics by entering your Google Analytics tracking ID
googleAnalytics = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;

############################
## Advanced options below ##
############################

# Name of Academic theme folder in `themes/`.
theme = [&amp;quot;academic&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;aafu&amp;quot;]

defaultContentLanguageInSubdir = false
removePathAccents = true  # Workaround for https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5687
# Get user avatars from Gravatar.com? (true/false)
gravatar = false

# Align the main menu to the right of the page? (true/false)
menu_align_right = false

# Show estimated reading time for posts? (true/false)
reading_time = true

# Display next/previous section pager? (true/false)
section_pager = false
docs_section_pager = true  # Display pager in Docs layout (e.g. tutorials)?

# Enable in-built social sharing buttons? (true/false)
sharing = true
paginate = 10  # Number of items per page in paginated lists.
# Taxonomies.
[taxonomies]
  tag = &amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;
  category = &amp;quot;categories&amp;quot;
  publication_type = &amp;quot;publication_types&amp;quot;
  author = &amp;quot;authors&amp;quot;

[params]
    title = &amp;quot;Jim Coll&amp;quot;
    author = &amp;quot;Darshan Baral&amp;quot;
    description = &amp;quot;Jim Coll&amp;quot;
    copyright = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of that file is the remains of the aafu theme.  To get menus to work, my &lt;i&gt;/config/_default/menus.toml&lt;/i&gt; file looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;# Navigation Links
#   To link a homepage widget, specify the URL as a hash `#` followed by the filename of the
#     desired widget in your `content/home/` folder.
#   The weight parameter defines the order that the links will appear in.
[[main]]
  name = &amp;quot;Main Website&amp;quot;
  url = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
  weight = 1
[[main]]
  name = &amp;quot;GEOG 358&amp;quot;
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/geog358/&amp;quot;
  weight = 2
[[main]]
  name = &amp;quot;GEOG 558&amp;quot;
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/geog558/&amp;quot;
  weight = 3
[[main]]
  name = &amp;quot;Drone Mapping&amp;quot;
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/dronemapping/&amp;quot;
  weight = 4
[[main]]
  name = &amp;quot;Random&amp;quot;
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/random/&amp;quot;
  weight = 4
  
[[geog358]]
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/geog358&amp;quot;
[[geog558]]
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/geog558&amp;quot;
[[random]]
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/random&amp;quot;
[[dronemapping]]
  url = &amp;quot;/courses/dronemapping&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways I&amp;rsquo;ve found to help improve my understanding of the sooftware/deployment was to change some of the layouts.  To add your resume to your image card as I have, you need to tweak the footer of the aafu theme, which should be in the &lt;i&gt;themes\academic\layouts\partials\footer.toml&lt;/i&gt;.  Mine now looks like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;footer class=&amp;quot;mb-4&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/random/media/JamesCollSharedWebResume.docx&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    A &amp;quot;More traditional&amp;quot; resume
  &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;amp;middot;
  &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;https://github.com/darshanbaral/aafu&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
      aafu
    &amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;free-and-open-source-software&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free and Open Source Software:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a whole host of questions I still have regarding the intersections of individuals, societies, economies, and technology.  One of the more practically philosophical realizations of this intersection than FOSS.  Free and Open Source Software has become one of my go to tools in tackling a problem and has that special allure of feel good contribution and intrinsic reproducibility to it.  I&amp;rsquo;ve created a few tools that take a FOSS approach to GIS, and here I&amp;rsquo;d like to demonstrate how to create one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll flesh this section out more at a later date, but two important links I&amp;rsquo;ve leaned heavily on in the creation of FOSSFlood and ClusteR.&lt;br /&gt;
Some useful links:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ficonsulting.com/filabs/RInno&#34;&gt;https://ficonsulting.com/filabs/RInno&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.robvanderwoude.com/vbstech_hta.php&#34;&gt;https://www.robvanderwoude.com/vbstech_hta.php&lt;/a&gt;  A great HTA resource page&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24789746/portable-browser-issues-when-deploying-r-shiny-app&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24789746/portable-browser-issues-when-deploying-r-shiny-app&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30965410/creating-stand-alone-shiny-app-chrome-error/31272180#31272180&#34;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30965410/creating-stand-alone-shiny-app-chrome-error/31272180#31272180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some useful tidbits of code, mostly in R, that I&amp;rsquo;ve flagged specifically.  Many are part of FOSSFlood, but that global file is more than 1000 lines of code so it&amp;rsquo;s understandable if you didn&amp;rsquo;t see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-project&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class project&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identify a biophysical, human, or environmental problem that requires or would benefit from your newfound knowledge of spatial analysis using GIS. Describe the problem that you are interested in. Provide geographic context to the problem.  Discuss what kind of GIS analysis you want to use and the implementation strategy you have chosen. Present simple diagrams or maps that illustrate your approach. Apply your approach to real-world data and present the results of your project in oral form. Students are also required to write a term paper based on the final project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intermediate deliverables count towards 10% of the final project grade&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A presentation which will count towards 25%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the term paper counts towards the remaining 65%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: the total project counts as 20% of your final grade, see the syllabus page for more details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;intermediate-deliverables&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermediate deliverables:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help keep you accountable, there will be several intermediate deliverables due throughout the semester.  This will be done in two stages:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; All students are required to write a proposal for the final project. In the proposal, you will describe the project you are planning to carry out, the GIS datasets needed, and GIS analysis functions may be used in the project. You will review the literature, what methods and GIS analysis functions have been used solving similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A draft of your paper:&lt;/strong&gt; To gage your progress and allow me time to provide you feedback, you will submit a draft of your paper which should at minimum contain an introduction and methods sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each student should plan on a 10-minutes presentation of your final project to the class (~7 minutes, 2 minutes for questions and a minute for transitions).  This can take several forms, including but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A slide deck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A research poster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-sanS6Y6cw&#34;&gt;A diorama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/j610c377_home_ku_edu/Ec71h8rMr6RKk1xG7qYec5EB2IkpnI3I3anTR23440IrIA?e=vYULkQ&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation order and grading rubric&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;note: The breakdown of the presentation will be as follows:
40%  will be the average of your classmates grades
10% will be for correctly filling in the grading sheet (participation)
the remaining 50% will be based on my grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;term-paper&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term paper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper should be far more comprehensive than your presentation, and reflective of your college education.  Spelling, grammar, and coherency are expected, and the paper should include the following sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The introduction should start broad and narrow in.  Make sure you provide enough background on your topic so that a non-expert could pick up your paper and have enough context to understand what the problem is, why spatial analysis is needed to solve your problem. Review in literature what methods and spatial analysis have been used solving similar problems. Be sure to include a statement like &amp;ldquo;The objective of this project is to &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Describe the strategy you solve the problem using GIS and any other necessary methods. Describe the statistic method, computer model, GIS analytic functions / operations you use in the problem solving process. Because this is a GIS class this section should include some of the finer details and methods used that would not normally be included in a peer reviewed or technical article.  Diagrams are especial helpful to understand your strategy.  This should include a dedicated Study Area and Analysis subsection where you describe the study area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Results

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here you present your findings, including final figures and the results (but not the meanings) of any statistical analysis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion &amp;amp; Conclusions

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This portion should briefly summarize the topic and question you answered with this project, the methods you employed and what your findings are.  Discuss the findings from your problem-solving process. Evaluate your methodology. Discuss the usefulness and limitation of the analytic functions in GIS.  Typically, this section also contains recommendations, both for what steps should be taken and the next research questions that should be addressed by future work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;References

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use whatever formatting you like.  I HIGHLY recommend a citation manager (see syllabus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These papers will be graded using the following criteria, with A-F ranges translated into their respective numerical counterparts.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/GEOG358GradeRubric.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful? tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the things that helps me approach papers like this is to find a similar paper in academic literature or a professional report and mirror it&amp;rsquo;s structure.  Feel free to do the same.  This should also go without saying but if you turn in a paper with screenshots and are not pointing out UI features I will automatically take 10 points off the paper grade.  You are here to learn ArcMap, demonstrate you have done so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are due throughout the semester (dates tentative and subject to change with notice):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;due-dates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposal&lt;/strong&gt; (1 ~ 3 pages, due &lt;strong&gt;Oct 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt; (due &lt;strong&gt;Nov. 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentations&lt;/strong&gt; (Week of  &lt;strong&gt;Dec 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Term Paper&lt;/strong&gt; (6 ~ 10 pages, due on &lt;strong&gt;Dec 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    This lab is here more for me as we walk through how to open and manipulate the interface, the meaning of icons, and how to navigate the world without getting lost.  The questions here are more to remind me to talk about things while we explore.  The instructions are not meant to be followed.  You should use this page more as an opportunity to learn how the labs will be laid out, how the sections are formatted, and how to navigate the site.  I&amp;rsquo;ll update this to a real lab at a later date.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lab will walk though how to open and manipulate the ESRI suite of tools and applications, common access patters, opening and manipulating windows, site layout, and how to submit things for the class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-submit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: Copy and paste the questions below into a word document and submit them on blackboard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 0: Answer Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 1&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the function of each of the following buttons? (Use your mouse &amp;amp; the tool tips if you are unsure)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the file size for Greenvalley.mxd?  ______ KB&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;: How many features are contained in parks_polygon feature class?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 4&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the projection used in the coordinate system (PCS) for the Hydrology feature dataset?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 5&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the datum used in the coordinate system for the Hydrology feature dataset?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 6&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the linear unit of measure for this feature dataset?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 7&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the spatial extent (listed under Domain) of this feature dataset?&lt;br /&gt;
Xmin:&lt;br /&gt;
Ymin:&lt;br /&gt;
Xmax:&lt;br /&gt;
Ymax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 8&lt;/strong&gt;: Which is the only feature dataset without coordinate system information?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;materials&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Data Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;BaseData&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;Data we downloaded as part of lab 1&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Links on these pages are green, and most of the time it should be obvious that something is a link.  So how many of you missed the fact that the materials was a link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-the-esri-suite-of-tools&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: The ESRI suite of tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArcCatalog&lt;/strong&gt; is an application for managing spatial data. The interface is similar to Windows Explorer and is used to copy, move, and delete data. In addition, ArcCatalog is used to obtain information about spatial data such as projection parameters, feature type (point, line, polygon), and attributes.  Never use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArcAdministrator&lt;/strong&gt; is where you control all the software, including extensions and licensing.  Rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArcScene&lt;/strong&gt; is a stand alone program for small scale GIS areas, and where you want to more explicitly show off 3D surfaces.  Rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArcGlobe&lt;/strong&gt; is ESRI&amp;rsquo;s attempt at a Google Earth substitute.  Rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArcMap&lt;/strong&gt; is the primary means of performing GIS.  Use often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArcPro&lt;/strong&gt; is the web enabled variant of ArcMap.  Because modern problems require modern solutions.  Use as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of metadata is an integral part of a GIS. Metadata is basically “data about data.” Information contained in metadata includes, but is not limited to, the creation and modification date, projection information, extent, source, and reliability. ArcCatalog offers several style sheets for the creation of metadata including the Federal Government Data Committee (FGDC) style. The FGDC coordinates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), which is designed to facilitate the sharing of geographic data. More information about FGDC can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fgdc.gov/index.html&#34;&gt;http://www.fgdc.gov/index.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-starting-arccatalog-and-organizing-data&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Starting ArcCatalog and Organizing Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First you need to create a personal folder on the D: drive. This is where you will store your data for the semester. On the desktop, you should see a folder in the upper left-hand corner with your name on it. Open it, and then create a new folder called G358.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start ArcCatalog by opening the #-Programs folder on the desktop and then double-clicking ArcCatalog 10.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcCatalog, you will firstly need to connect to a folder. Click on the ‘Connect to Folder’ icon .    And then navigate to the data you downloaded&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure that the G358 folder is highlighted before clicking OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Catalog Tree (the leftmost panel of the window), click the plus sign next to the connection you just made. Now right-click on Lab01 and select Copy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Connect to Folder icon again and create a connection to your personal lab folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Catalog Tree, find the connection to your lab folder, right-click the folder, and then select Paste. Now you have a copy of the lab data in your own folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the plus sign next to your Lab00 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-getting-familiar-with-the-layout-of-arccatalog&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Getting Familiar with the layout of ArcCatalog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Catalog Tree, click the plus sign next to Lab01 in your folder (see figure on next page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contents of this folder are listed in the Catalog Display window:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A database file (GreenValleyDB.mdb)¬ – a data format used by ArcGIS based on a relational database that contains geographic information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A map document (Greenvalley.mxd) – a page layout for spatial data and contains annotations and graphic elements. The map document can either be printed or saved in a graphic format (.jpg, .tif, .eps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A layer file (Water Use.lyr) – contains symbology settings for water use in Greenvalley. These settings tell ArcMap how to display the data and can also be a shortcut to the original data stored elsewhere on the hard drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the following page in order to familiarize yourself with the layout of ArcCatalog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will want to refer to this outline throughout the lab if you get confused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArcCatalog is similar in structure to Windows Explorer &amp;ndash; on the left hand side is a view of the Catalog &amp;ldquo;tree&amp;rdquo; showing how the data is organized. The right hand side provides options for exploring the contents of the data shown in the Catalog tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outside of the areas for exploring the catalog folders and their contents, there are several menus and toolbars associated with ArcCatalog. We will explore a number of these in this lab, however we will not examine all of them. Throughout the lab, it will be helpful if you spend a bit of time exploring these on your own as they become active.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find out what a particular button does, hold your mouse cursor over the button for several seconds. A note will appear telling you the function associated with the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-exploring-the-geographic-data-map-documents-and-layers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Exploring the geographic data, map documents and layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the settings of Details view: The default settings for the Details view in the Catalog Contents window only show the Name and Type of feature. We want to obtain more information about the files we are using before continuing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Customize | ArcCatalog Options… and navigate to the Contents tab.  Place check marks beside Size and Modified. Also, place a check mark beside # of Features under the metadata list box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Apply and then click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete questions 1 – 3 on the assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to preview the map document, single-click the Map document     (Greenvalley.mxd) in the Catalog Tree and select the Preview tab to view a thumbnail of page layout. Notice that there is only one option available from the Preview: drop-down menu (Geography). This is because we can only view the spatial information contained within the map document.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To preview a layer, single-click the layer file   (Water Use.lyr)   in the Catalog Tree to preview this file. The Preview: option defaults to Geography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change this drop-down menu to Table. A table is displayed in the Catalog Display window showing the attributes for the original data associated with the layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Contents tab and click on the geodatabase file named GreenvalleyDB.mdb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To explore the geodatabase, click the plus sign next to the file GreenvalleyDB.mdb in the Catalog Tree. The contents of this geodatabase are now displayed in the Catalog Tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Hydrology, Parks, Public Buildings, etc… are called Feature Datasets and are simply a collection of Feature Classes (Points, Lines, Polygons) that share the same spatial reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore feature datasets and feature classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the plus sign next to Hydrology and note the content is a single Feature Class (in this case, a polygon) called flood_polygon. A thumbnail is displayed in
the Catalog Display window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer question 4 on the answer sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Preview tab to view the geographic information stored in the flood_polygon class. Switch to the Table option to see the attributes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the Contents tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Catalog Tree, select Public Utility. Notice that this Feature Dataset contains three Feature Classes (a point, line and polygon feature class). Click the plus sign for this Feature Dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Preview tab and view the Geography and Table for each of these feature classes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-finding-coordinate-system-information&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Finding coordinate system information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information regarding the projection and its parameters (coordinate system, datum, spheroid, etc…) can be obtained for each Feature Dataset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click on the Hydrology Feature dataset and select Properties… from the drop-down menu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll through this information to become familiar with some of the parameters that are stored within this Feature Dataset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer 5 – 9 on the assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the Properties window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-exploring-and-editing-metadata&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Exploring and editing metadata&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   ArcCatalog can also be used to create and search metadata.  Under the Transportation feature dataset, single-click the streets_arc feature class.
•   Select the Description tab to view the feature class metadata.
•   To edit information, click the Edit button under the Description tab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   Under each item, information can be added about the features contained within this feature class including tags, summary, description, etc. This can be used to identify the contents of the feature class, to locate the file, to find out who created it, and so on.
        Under the Tags section, add the following text:
o   Street, street name
          Under the Summary section, add the following text:
o   To store the street center lines of Greenvalley
•   Click Save once you have made these changes. These changes should now be viewable under the Description tab&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete Question 10 on the assignment sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connecting to other sources of data
Up to this point we’ve been accessing data that is stored on the lab computers. Now we’re going to use the Internet to access data from other sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   First we’re going to connect to the Kansas Data Access and Support Center (KansasGIS.org), a great service run by our friends over at the Kansas Geological Survey. Their data are stored on servers that run on ArcGIS Server. We can access these data in ArcCatalog by using an ArcGIS Server connection.
•   In the Catalog Tree, about halfway down you’ll see GIS Servers. Click the plus sign next to it.
•   Double-click Add ArcGIS Server.
•   Make sure the radio button is set to Use GIS services. Click Next.
•   In the Server URL field, type: &lt;a href=&#34;http://services.kansasgis.org/arcgis/services&#34;&gt;http://services.kansasgis.org/arcgis/services&lt;/a&gt;
•   Click Finish.
•   Click the plus sign next to arcgis on services.kansasgis.org (user).
•   Click the minus sign next to DASC_Boundaries.
•   Click the plus sign next to KDOR.
•   Click the first CountyOrkaStatus.
•   Click the Full Extent button (the little globe near the top of the screen).
•   Click the Identify button (the blue circle with an &amp;ldquo;i&amp;rdquo; in it).
•   Click different counties to see their attributes.
•   Scroll through the Identify Results window.
•   Answer question 11 on the assignment sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to connect to a different server at a different organization through a
different process. (It’s different, see?) This time we’re connecting to the servers at the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a government agency that runs the
National Weather Service and other related services. Instead of using an ArcGIS Server
connection, though, we’re going to use WMS (Web Map Service). According to Wikipedia,
WMS is a “standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet that are generated by a map server using data from a GIS database.” Unlike ArcGIS Server, WMS is an open source protocol, which means it’s not connected to any proprietary software.
•   In the Catalog Tree, double-click Add WMS Server.
•   In the URL field, type: &lt;a href=&#34;http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/arcgis/services/hot_springs/MapServer/WMSServer?&#34;&gt;http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/arcgis/services/hot_springs/MapServer/WMSServer?&lt;/a&gt;
•   Click OK.
•   Click the plus sign next to hot_springs on maps.ngdc.noaa.gov.
•   Click the plus sign next to Thermal Springs in the United States.
•   Click the plus sign next to Layers.
•   Click Hot Springs.
•   Click the Full Extent button (the little globe).
•   Answer question 12 (last question!) on the assignment sheet.
 
Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This final step contains detailed instructions for turning your work in. We will do this frequently throughout the semester so be sure to pay attention to the process.
•   Scroll so that your screen looks like the following (so that it displays the changes you made in metadata).
•   This also should bring the ArcCatalog to be captured to the foreground on your computer screen or make the ArcCatalog active window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   Locate the PrtScrn key (Print Screen) on your keyboard (see sample keyboard for a guide).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•   Press the Alt + PrtScrn key – this key is used to capture (or take a picture of) your screen.
•   For the process described below, you can use the other image editor rather than Paint as you wish.
•   Now open Paint by going to Start | All Programs | Accessories | Paint
•   On the Paint toolbar, click the Paste button under the Home tab – this will paste a picture of your screen into Paint
•   Now choose Save As…
•   Navigate to your folder&lt;br /&gt;
•   Under File Name: enter lab01yourname.png (i.e.: lab01Bruce.png)
•   From the Save as Type drop down box, select PNG
•   Close Paint and exit from ArcCatalog
•   To upload the file, simply launch Microsoft Internet Explorer (or Firefox if available) and log into Blackboard.
•   Click on Assignments | Lab 01 | Submit Lab 01
•   Fill in any appropriate information, and click Browse… to browse, find, and upload your .PNG file from your personal workspace. Finally, click Submit.
•   I will now be able to view your .PNG through the Blackboard webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the 2010 population for Douglas County?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dots signify hot springs on American soil. Where in the U.S. do hot springs seem to be concentrated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    These labs are largely written for ArcMap 10.6.  However, operations from ArcMap 10.2 through 10.6 and even up to Pro all largely look the same although some of the tools may have shifted or changed names just to keep you on your toes.  Although these labs are written so that you can follow them step by step, I expect you to flex those critical thinking skills of yours.  Take a step back, read the learning objectives and ask yourself what steps are needed to get to that goal.  When in doubt, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmgtfy.com/&#34;&gt;Google it&lt;/a&gt;!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-1-a-survey-of-data-and-mapping-technologies-and-database-building&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 1: A survey of data and mapping technologies and database building&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this lab requires writing a survey of the data and mapping technologies in the field that you are interested in (wildlife reserve, conservation, urban planning, forest resources, natural hazards, business, etc.), not limited to the data and mapping technologies covered in the lecture. This survey may include both traditional and new emerging datasets and/or mapping technologies that are used in the fields. The second part of the lab will download imagery and create a database that will be used for the next few labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-submit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit the paper outlined in part 1, and the screenshot of the data you downloaded in part 2 to blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-70-points-a-survey-of-data-and-mapping-technologies&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1 (70 points): A survey of data and mapping technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will write a survey on the data and mapping technologies in a field that you are interested in. The survey should have 2-4 single spaced pages using a font size of 12 points. Reference style should follow one of the GIS journal reference styles (e.g. Transactions in GIS, Cartography and Geographic Information Science, International Journal of Geographic Information Science, The Geographical Journal, and Computers &amp;amp; Geosciences, etc.). I also point you to several resources for reference management software &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/classoutline/#academic-integrity&#34;&gt;syllabus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grading for the survey is based on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(80%) Quality of the content: how many potential datasets and mapping methods are included; How you organize your contents. Whether the length of survey is proper, and has a proper level of synthesis and details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(20%) Format: follow the requirements described above and check your grammar, spelling and sentence structures before you submit the survey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-2-30-points-building-a-database&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2 (30 points): Building a database&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our goals over the the next couple of labs is to recreate part of the analysis found in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2018.00210/full&#34;&gt;Frey et al., 2018&lt;/a&gt;, specifically Figure 2 and a lake volume estimation.  We will use these data in the next couple of labs and I will not wait for you to download them next week so be prepared to have them ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-folders-and-accounts&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up folders and accounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of file management system is preferable to nothing.  Time wasted looking for files can be better spent performing the analysis, other research, or discovering new music.  Below I will outline what I use, but if you already have a system that works for you feel free to deviate.  Just as an aside, avoid file names with spaces, leading numbers, or strange characters.
&lt;li&gt;On OneDrive, create a folder for classes, in that one for this class (GEOG558), and in that folder create one for labs.  In that folder create one for Lab01, and one for base data (BaseData).  In that create folders, one called Elevation and the other called Landsat.  The Landsat tiles can get a little messy so I create extra folders underneath the Landsat folder titled something along the lines of LS05_YYYY.  
&lt;li&gt;We will use USGS Earth Explorer to download the requisite datasets, including Landsat scenes and elevation data.  Before we start you&#39;ll need accounts at both &lt;a href=&#34;https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/&#34;&gt;https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/&#34;&gt;https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/&lt;/a&gt;  
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;downloading-data&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downloading data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up &lt;a href=&#34;https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/&#34;&gt;Earthexplorer&lt;/a&gt;  
&lt;li&gt;We first need to define our area of interest.  Under the Search Criteria tab change the coordinate box to decimal degrees, add a coordinate, and copy/paste the following into their respective fields.  
&lt;/ol&gt;  
  

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latitude: -9.397055203542507&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Longitude: -77.38027425750124&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Data Sets tab, search for &lt;a href=&#34;https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003&#34;&gt;SRTM3 SRTMGL-1&lt;/a&gt; and make sure the box next to the dataset is checked.  Click results and then download the standard format (the HGT, not any of the metadata).  
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few useful buttons on a results screen.  The black footprint shows you the footprint of a tile, and the image icon will draw a jpg over the browser so you can see what the data you&amp;rsquo;re downloading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elevation data is distributed as a nested zip file.  To use it you&#39;ll need to unzip it twice to actually use it in a program.  Unzip (Right click &gt; 7-Zip &gt; Extract to “FileNameHere”) the SRTMGL folder and move the HGT file (a fancy tif for SRTM data) intoyour folder structure.  
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we want the Landsat scenes.  We&amp;rsquo;ll simplify this somewhat by starting at 1995 and looking forward in time every 2 year.  We&amp;rsquo;ll also use scenes taken in the winter, so that the lake is stable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;5&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Data Sets tab, navigate to the Landsat &amp;gt; Landsat Collection 1 Level 1 check &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-landsat-archives-landsat-4-5-thematic-mapper-tm-level-1-data?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects&#34;&gt;Landsat 4-5 TM C1 Level-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Date Range dates to 06/01/1995 and 08/01/1995 respectively.
&lt;li&gt;Click on Additional Criteria, set the Land Cloud Cover to less than 10%&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Results, when the images load in you can explore them with the “Show Browser Overlay” button, and download the desired tiles (Get the Level-1 GeoTIFF data products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this for every two years up to 2009 (change the Date Range on the Search Criteria tab).  The images I selected for this analysis were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;YEAR&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;SCENE NAME&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1995&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_19950622_20170109_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1997&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_19970729_20161230_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1999&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_19990601_20161217_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2001&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_20010622_20161210_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2003&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_20030714_20161205_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2005&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_20050703_20161126_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2007&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008067_20070725_20161112_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2009&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;LT05_L1TP_008066_20090628_20161024_01_T1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Landsat tiles are downloaded with extensions .tar.gz, they’ve also essentially been compressed twice.  Unzip them the first time, open them up and unzip them a second time.  Copy all the files into their respective folders.
&lt;li&gt;Open up ArcMap and the ArcCatalog window, connect to the lab folder, and expand the BaseData file tree out a bit.  Submit a screenshot of your final files (similar to the one below).&lt;br /&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    These labs are largely written for ArcMap 10.6, though operations from ArcMap 10.2 through 10.6 all largely look the same, although some of the tools may have shifted.  The first handful of labs are designed to be followed as is, but as the semester progresses I expect you to flex those critical thinking skills of yours.  Take a step back, read the learning objectives and ask yourself what steps would be needed to get to that goal.  When in doubt, &lt;a href=&#34;https://lmgtfy.com/&#34;&gt;Google it&lt;/a&gt;!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-1-introduction-to-arcmap&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 1: Introduction to ArcMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To introduce ArcGIS and its basic data management, display, and analysis components. To learn how to work with map layers, query attribute tables and geographic features, create maps, and design and execute a simple GIS analysis. As a demonstration, you will map and analyze data from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, complete the tutorial by following the steps below. Then, using the skills you&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the tutorial, complete the assignment given following the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: lab design guided by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leehach&#34;&gt;https://github.com/leehach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tutorial&#34;&gt;Tutorial&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;acquiring-the-data&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acquiring the Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;workspace&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a technical way of referring to a project folder, the folder where you store your data files, including both inputs and outputs. Thus, when you see a reference to &amp;lsquo;your workspace&amp;rsquo; here, you can think of it as &amp;ldquo;your Lab1 data folder&amp;rdquo;. Using the term &amp;ldquo;workspace&amp;rdquo; is more concise, and when you become a more advanced GIS user, setting the workspace becomes an important part of automating complex processes. If you have a flash drive, create a new workspace folder named &amp;lsquo;Lab2&amp;rsquo;. If you do not have a flash drive create a new folder in the Documents folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First we will acquire the following spatial data layers for the city of Philadelphia: schools, bike routes, and neighborhoods. We will download data from &lt;strong&gt;PASDA&lt;/strong&gt; (The Pennsylvania Geospatial Clearinghouse), which is an example of a &lt;strong&gt;geoportal&lt;/strong&gt;, a website that collects geospatial data from many different sources organized around a particular theme or region of interest. Unsurprisingly, PASDA, hosts data related to Pennsylvania, and is maintained by Pennsylvania State University. PASDA hosts data provided by local governments, federal and state agencies, nonprofits, and academic institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pasda.psu.edu/&#34;&gt;http://www.pasda.psu.edu.&lt;/a&gt; Under SEARCH BY KEYWORD(S) enter &amp;lsquo;Philadelphia&amp;rsquo; and press submit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find 2016 Philadelphia Planning - Schools, click on the link, press Download, which will download a file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to schools, find and download the following: 2016 Philadelphia Streets - Bike Network &amp;amp; 2016 Philadelphia Planning - Neighborhoods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Check step) You should have downloaded and be able to locate 3 files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PhillyPlanning_Schools.zip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PhillyPlanning_Neighborhoods.zip&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PhillyStreets_Bike_Network.zip&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice all 3 files are .zip files, which is a single file that is composed of one or more individual files that have been compressed to a smaller storage size for convenience. The lab computers will automatically save the zip files to the Downloads folder. Copy or move these files to your Lab1 workspace folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unzip the archive. The lab computers have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.7-zip.org/&#34;&gt;7-Zip&lt;/a&gt; installed on them. In File Explorer, right-click the file and choose &lt;strong&gt;7-Zip → Extract to &amp;ldquo;folder_name&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unzip each of the .zip files using the 7-zip application (or another appropriate application) and extract the files to your workspace folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-arcmap-and-adding-map-layers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening ArcMap and Adding Map Layers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open ArcMap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Document dialog will appear. Click OK to begin with a blank
map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When you are starting with a new map, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter whether you close this dialog by clicking OK, Cancel, or the &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; at the upper right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the Add Data Button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Add Data browser window click the &amp;lsquo;Connect to Folder&amp;rsquo; button, navigate to your workspace folder, and press OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate into your workspace folder and add the neighborhoods, schools, and bike network data layers to ArcMap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding the files, it should look something like this (the colors may be different):
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;table-of-contents-toc&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table of Contents (TOC)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left panel of panel in ArcMap is called the &amp;ldquo;Table of Contents&amp;rdquo;. The TOC lists all the map layers found in the map window and shows what the geographic features in each map layer represent (points, lines, polygons, images, tables). The table of contents helps you manage the display order of map layers and symbols used to represent layers, as well as set the display and other properties (e.g. colors, line thickness) for each map layer. It is also the place where you can easily see the drive paths where your files are physically located on the computer (e.g., C:\temp\mygisfiles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;font color=&#39;red&#39;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is very important to remember where your files are located when you are working on a GIS project. In a GIS environment you will be doing a lot of data processing which requires the creation of new files, which must be saved. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where you saved a file, your instructor is not going to know either.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Hint: if you click on geoprocessing &amp;gt; results and expand the top most tool to see where Arcmap last dumped something out*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the top of the TOC is a toolbar that controls how the layers are listed, and what you can do to them. You can hover over the buttons to see tooltips for their function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List By Drawing Order&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List By Source&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List By Visibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List By Selection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the List By Drawing Order button (if it is not already selected)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try changing the order of the map layers. Click, hold, and drag the neighborhoods layer to the top. Notice that now that is &amp;lsquo;on top&amp;rsquo; it visually obscures the other layers (schools and bike network) below it. Drag and drop the schools and bike network layers to the top again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the List By Source button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the path, i.e. the drive and folder hierarchy, within which each layer is stored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also turn layers on and off (i.e. make them visible or not) by simply checking or unchecking the box next to the layer name in the Table of Contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-arcmap-documents-mxd-files&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are ArcMap documents? (.mxd files)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ArcMap documents (which have the .mxd extension) allow desktop users to save and share their GIS project with other desktop users or reopen a project at a future time. After an ArcMap document is created and its various map properties are defined (map colors, projection), all of the properties of the GIS map are saved as part of the map document. Remember that the map document file (.mxd) only saves ArcMap document properties and the location of the map layers that are being used and does not save the geospatial data (that is, the data in the shapefiles or other geospatial data format). The ArcMap document will only reference the location where the data files are saved. If you move your data files to a different drive path or folder and then open your project, you will have to locate the files again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;saving-a-map-document&#34;&gt;Saving a Map Document&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click File, Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your workspace and save the project as Lab2.mxd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the ArcMap software completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opening-your-arcmap-document-mxd-file&#34;&gt;Opening your ArcMap Document (.mxd file)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with Microsoft Word or other Windows applications, if you have an existing map document, you can open it directly from the desktop. You do not have to have ArcMap already open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In File Explorer, navigate to your map document file (Lab1.mxd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double-click the file to launch ArcMap and open your existing document. Again, as with other Windows applications, you can open an existing map document from the File menu. The File menu will also list recently opened documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;remove-map-layers-from-map-document&#34;&gt;Remove Map Layers from Map Document&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click Neighborhoods from the popup menu and click Remove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close ArcMap completely. Do not save your changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;organizing-gis-data&#34;&gt;Organizing GIS data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most challenging parts of learning GIS is organizing your
files and understanding where they are stored. You will find out in
the next few weeks that when you perform spatial operations and/or
geoprocess your data ArcGIS often creates new files. You need to stay
organized (check you paths and know where the data are being stored).
The faster you get this concept, the quicker you will learn the more
important GIS concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many different spatial data formats. Vector data (points,
lines and polygons) are commonly stored in &lt;strong&gt;shapefiles&lt;/strong&gt;. A shapefile
is a simple, nontopological format (topology will be explained later
this term) for storing the geometric location and attribute
information of geographic features. Geographic features in a shapefile
can be represented by points, lines, or polygons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shapefile format defines the geometry and attributes of
geographically referenced features in three or more files with
specific file extensions that should be stored in the same folder.
Each file must have the same base name in order for ArcGIS to
recognize them as part of the same spatial layer, for example,
schools.shp, schools.shx, and schools.dbf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are common shapefile extensions. The first three (.shp,
.shx, .dbf) are &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; by the shapefile standard:&lt;br/&gt;
    - .shp&amp;mdash;The main file that stores the feature geometry; required.&lt;br/&gt;
    - .shx&amp;mdash;The index file that stores the index of the feature geometry; required.&lt;br/&gt;
    - .dbf&amp;mdash;The dBASE table that stores the attribute information of features; required.&lt;br/&gt;
    - .prj&amp;mdash;The file that stores the coordinate system information. &lt;strong&gt;All&lt;/strong&gt; spatial data use &lt;strong&gt;some&lt;/strong&gt; CRS (coordinate reference system), but shapefiles are sometimes distributed without the PRJ file. How to deal with that will be demonstrated in a future exercise.&lt;br/&gt;
    - .sbn and .sbx&amp;mdash;The files that store the spatial index of the features.&lt;br/&gt;
    - .xml&amp;mdash;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata&lt;/strong&gt; (&amp;ldquo;data about data&amp;rdquo;) for ArcGIS&amp;mdash;stores information about the shapefile, such as the source of the data, accuracy, publication date, time period, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;viewing-shapefiles-between-folders&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viewing Shapefiles between Folders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This section aims to show you that shapefiles are composed of many files that you must transport all together in one group to another location. Additionally, it is important to note where all the files are stored for each project that you work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open File Explorer and navigate to your workspace folder and examine the schools shapefile. There should be 8 files with the base name PhillyPlanning_Schools. These files must be kept together to be maintained. &lt;em&gt;THE LOSS OF ANY ONE OF THESE FILES CAN BREAK THE SHAPEFILE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcCatalog and navigate to your workspace so you can view the schools shapefile. Note that it appears as a single file in ArcCatalog, even though it is actually composed of 8 individual files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcCatalog you can rename, copy, and move shapefiles, just as you can in File Explorer, and it will automatically maintain the integrity of all files that compose the shapefile. It is recommended to use the ArcCatalog windows to rename, copy, and move GIS data files (though it is still possible to use File Explorer for this purpose).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close ArcCatalog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;repairing-broken-data-links&#34;&gt;Repairing Broken Data Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArcMap and ArcCatalog should be closed when you begin this section. Your Lab1 workspace folder should have a map document named Lab1.mxd which is linked to data in that folder. We are going to break that link and learn how to repair it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to break the link by moving the map document. It could also be broken by moving the data to a new folder, or, if the data were not in the same folder as the map document, by renaming the data folder. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have relative paths set (see next section), it can also be broken just by plugging your flash drive into a new computer and having it mount on a different drive letter. All of these are very common occurrences, so it is very likely that you will encounter broken data links when working with GIS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In File Explorer, move Lab1.mxd to a new location (this can be the desktop for ease of use)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double-click Lab1.mxd to open ArcMap. Notice that the map canvas is empty, and all of the layers have a red exclamation mark next to them. This indicates that a layer is defined in the map document, but the source data is not at the expected location. Any layer properties, such as the color of polygon features, are preserved, even if ArcMap can&amp;rsquo;t find the polygons to display!
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click on any of the layers in the TOC. From the popup menu select Data → Repair Data Source.&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the correct shapefile for the layer you clicked on. Select it and hit the Add button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that ArcMap has repaired the link for not just that layer, but for all the other layers as well. The Repair Data Source feature will check whether other map document layers come from the same data source. In this case, since all of the shapefiles are in the same folder, all of the data links were repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close ArcMap &lt;strong&gt;but do not save your changes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Move Lab1.mxd back into the Lab1 folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-relative-paths&#34;&gt;Using Relative Paths&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A file location can be stored using an &lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt; or a &lt;strong&gt;relative&lt;/strong&gt; path. In the real world, an absolute path would be a location specified in some address system, like &amp;ldquo;1801 N. Broad Street&amp;rdquo;. A relative path would be a location specified in relation to your current location, like &amp;ldquo;walk two blocks, turn left, walk three blocks, and go into the third building on the right&amp;rdquo;. When you add geographic layers and tables to ArcMap and save the project (.mxd), the software does NOT store the data. It stores the paths to the data. When you use absolute paths, the data must be at the exact same location in the filesystem. If you work on a lab computer and store your map document and data in C:\temp\mystuff, but go home and copy the data to C:\other_folder\mystuff, ArcMap will not find the data, even though it is right there. If you work on a flash drive that is mounted as drive letter E:\, but then go work on another computer (or even return to the same computer) that happens to mount the flash drive as drive letter F:\, ArcMap will not find the data. In order to make sure that you keep your map document connected to your data, you must:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use relative paths for the map document.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy your map document (MXD) and data as a unit. This will be easiest if you keep the data in the same folder as or an immediate subfolder (perhaps named &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo;) of the map document.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relative or absolute paths is a property of the map document, so you may choose to have some that use relative paths and some that use absolute paths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the path settings as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reopen your Lab1.mxd map document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click File → Map Document Properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check &amp;ldquo;Store relative pathnames to data sources&amp;rdquo; (if it is not checked) and Press OK.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Usually, working with relative paths is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-handful-of-basic-operations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A handful of basic operations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;changing-the-symbology-of-map-layers&#34;&gt;Changing the Symbology of Map Layers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In ArcGIS it is very easy to change the colors and symbols of map layers. Let&amp;rsquo;s try changing the color and symbols of the map layers in your Lab1 map document&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-color&#34;&gt;Change Color&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off the bike network and schools layers so only neighborhoods is showing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double click the neighborhoods layer in the TOC. (You can also right-click on the layer and select Properties from the popup menu.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the Symbology tab.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the colored polygon symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select a new &amp;lsquo;fill&amp;rsquo; color and select a color from the color palette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select &amp;lsquo;outline&amp;rsquo; color and select a new color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to choose a fill and outline color that makes it easy to see the individual neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click OK to see the new color settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-point-glyph-symbol-and-color&#34;&gt;Change Point Glyph (Symbol) and Color&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off all the layers except for the schools layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Double click the schools layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click point symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down and change the glyph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the fill color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure to choose a glyph and fill color that makes it easy to see the individual schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-tools-toolbar-to-navigate-and-get-information&#34;&gt;Using the Tools Toolbar to Navigate and Get Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
ArcMap has many toolbars, which can be toggled on and off in the Customize menu. A default installation will start with the following two toolbars visible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;This has file management features and actions common to almost all Windows software, including opening and saving files, cut-copy-paste, and undo-redo. We have already used to add spatial data to our map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;mdash;This has a number of tools commonly and specifically used for working with geospatial data. We will explore it now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: Hover the mouse over each of the different buttons to see their name and description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;zoom-and-pan&#34;&gt;Zoom and Pan&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &amp;lsquo;zoom in&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;zoom out&amp;rsquo; tool you can navigate to and from close-up views. The pan tool shifts the display in any direction without changing the scale of the map&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try the zoom tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try the pan tool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;full-extent-previous-extent-and-next-extent&#34;&gt;Full Extent, Previous Extent, and Next Extent&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map extent tools allow you to navigate through map extents. A map extent defines the geographic boundaries for displaying map layers within a data frame. &lt;strong&gt;Try the different map extent tools.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;identify-features&#34;&gt;Identify Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The identify tool allows you to quickly get attribute information about a geographic feature. Let&amp;rsquo;s try to get info about the neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off all the layers except the neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select the &amp;lsquo;Identify&amp;rsquo; tool and click on one of the neighborhoods. The Identify window will appear. This shows you the attribute values from the attribute table for that neighborhood, such as its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are not getting info about the neighborhoods, then you will need to change the &amp;ldquo;Identify from&amp;rdquo; layer in the dropdown at the top of the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try using this tool on the other map layers.
&amp;gt; Note that when features are close together (e.g. a bike network nearby a school), the Identify tool may select several nearby features. Zoom in until you can select a single feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;measure-distances-and-areas&#34;&gt;Measure Distances and Areas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skill demonstration: Can you tell me how big Philadelphia is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the Measure tool on the Tools toolbar to open the Measure dialog box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the measure menu opens, click on the units dropdown menu (its down arrow), select distance, and then miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the northeastern tip of Philadelphia and then drag the ruler drag ruler tool to the southwestern tip and double click to take the measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the Measure tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;selecting-things-in-arcmap&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selecting things in ArcMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting and subsetting a database is one of the most fundamental operations one can do to data.  In AcrMap there are several ways one can go about accomplishing this feat.  This section will walk you the three most useful ways to select something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-with-attribute-tables&#34;&gt;Working with Attribute Tables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with feature classes (points, lines, and polygons) and image datasets (referred to more generally as raster datasets), tables represent one of the three key dataset types in GIS. Tables are used to store descriptive attributes about geographic features (e.g., census data for counties or census tracts, disease counts by health district).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;opening-the-attribute-table&#34;&gt;Opening the Attribute Table&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off all layers except for schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click the schools layer in the TOC (table of contents) and select &amp;lsquo;Open Attribute Table&amp;rsquo; from the popup menu.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
The table containing the records for schools should open.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attribute fields names appear at the top. Scroll across the table to view them all. Some important fields are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FACIL_NAME which contains the name of the school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ENROLLMENT which contains the number of students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GRADE_LEVE which contains the grade level of the school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TYPE_SPECI which indicates whether the school is run by the&amp;hellip;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;District (Philadelphia School District)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charter school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archdiocese (Catholic parish) school&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down the table to view the records. Note the total number of records (rows) in the layer appears at the bottom (550 schools), along with a count of how many are currently selected, which at the moment should be 0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the attribute table for the bike network layer. Note the important fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STREETNAME which indicates the name of the street&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TYPE which indicates the type of bike lane

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buffered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conventional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharrow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;conventional with sharrow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the attribute table for the neighborhood layer. Note the important fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NAME indicating the name of the neighborhood&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close all the attribute tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;select-by-attribute-attribute-query&#34;&gt;Select by Attribute (Attribute Query)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attribute query helps users select or view certain data on the map based on that data&amp;rsquo;s attributes. It works the same way as a relational database like Microsoft Access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured Query Language (SQL)&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of defined expressions and syntax used to query and manipulate data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) defines a standard for SQL. Most RDBMSs use that standard and have extended it, making SQL syntax across different RDBMSs slightly different from one another. Query expressions are used in ArcGIS to select a subset of features and table records. Query expressions in ArcGIS adhere to standard SQL expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to select geographic features is directly from the attribute table. From a table, you can manually select records with the mouse pointer, or you could select those records that meet some criteria (SQL query). Once you&amp;rsquo;ve selected records in the table, you&amp;rsquo;ll see those features selected (highlighted) on your map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;manual-selection&#34;&gt;Manual Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the schools attribute table. Right click on the FACIL_NAME field and select &amp;lsquo;Sort Ascending&amp;rsquo;. This puts the schools in alphabetical order by name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down the table until you find the Dunbar, Paul Laurence school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the row on the far left of the table to manually select that row (see circle in the picture below). Note the Dunbar school will be highlighted to show its selection &amp;ndash; in both the attribute table and in the map (it is adjacent to Temple University Main Campus). Note that at bottom of the table it should indicate 1 out of 550 schools are selected.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image12.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear the selection by clicking the Clear Selection button on the attribute table or in ArcMap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;attribute-query&#34;&gt;Attribute Query&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the attribute table go the Table Options button at the top left and choose Select by Attributes.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image14.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dialog box will pop up that allows to make a query statement. We will create a query that states which schools will be selected based on some criteria, in this example, the school with the name Dunbar, Paul Laurence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Select by Attributes dialog, note that the beginning of a standard SQL query appears above the lower text box: SELECT * FROM PhillyPlanning_Schools WHERE. The WHERE keyword indicates that a criteria is about to specified. The database engine will use this criteria to &lt;strong&gt;filter&lt;/strong&gt; the records, that is, to select only those records which satisfy the criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top box, double click \&amp;ldquo;FACIL_NAME\&amp;ldquo;. It should appear in the text box below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the equals (=) button, then click the Get Unique Values button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down in the list of school names and double click \&amp;lsquo;Dunbar, Paul Laurence\&amp;lsquo;. Note that the column name appears in double quotes. Text values, such as the school name, appear in single quotes. You should form a query appearing in the text box at the bottom of the dialog box:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image15.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Apply. The same school should be selected in the table and on the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the Select by Attributes box and clear your selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another example, let&amp;rsquo;s select schools with enrollments over 500 students. Open Select by Attributes and delete the last query statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a query statement by double clicking the ENROLLMENT field at the top, then the greater than (&amp;gt;) button then type in 500. Note that 500 is a numeric value, and does not appear in quotes. Press Apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selection should show that 212 out of 550 schools have enrollments over 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also create a compound query. Build a new query in the Select By Attributes dialog box query window by clicking on the buttons that reads \&amp;ldquo;TYPE_SPECI\&amp;rdquo; = \&amp;lsquo;District\&amp;rsquo; AND \&amp;ldquo;ENROLLMENT\&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; 600. This will select only schools run by the Philadelphia School District (as opposed to charter, private, or Archdiocese schools) with enrollments greater than 600 students.
&amp;gt; Check: There should be 77 schools selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the Select by Attributes box, clear your selection, and close the attribute table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;graphical-selection&#34;&gt;Graphical Selection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also select features interactively on the map.  The Tools toolbar in ArcMap contains a tool for graphically selecting features. The &amp;lsquo;Select Features&amp;rsquo; tool works using a single graphic that you interactively digitize (draw) as part of the selection process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the Select Features button, then click &amp;lsquo;Select by Rectangle&amp;rsquo;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image18.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the cursor draw a rectangle around a set of schools, say, the schools in West Philadelphia.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image19.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examine the selected records on the map and in the schools attribute table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also perform a graphical selection using a circle or other shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment with different graphical selection options. When you are finished, clear your selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;select-by-location-spatial-selection&#34;&gt;Select by Location (Spatial Selection)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also select features based on their spatial relationship to another feature, such as the distance between features or whether one feature contains another feature. As an example we will select schools located within 500 feet of the bike network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn on the schools and bike network layers (neighborhoods should be off).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the menu at the top, choose Selection, then Select by Location.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image20.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Select By Location dialog box choose&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selection method: Select features from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the box next to PhillyPlanning_Schools (since you want to select schools)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source Layer: PhillyStreets_Bike_Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spatial selection method for target layer feature(s): are within a distance of the source layer feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a search distance: 250 Feet
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image21.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see 140 of the 550 schools selected. Open the attribute table for the schools layer to see how many schools are selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear your selection so no schools are selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-statistics-for-selected-records&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Statistics for Selected Records&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When exploring a table, you can immediately get statistics describing the numeric values in the columns. When you use the statistics tool you&amp;rsquo;ll see how many values the column has, as well as the sum, minimum, mean, maximum, and standard deviation of those values. A histogram is also provided showing how the column&amp;rsquo;s values are distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, we will get statistics from the schools attribute table:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear all your selections so no schools are selected. Open the schools attribute table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click the heading of the field Enrollment and select &amp;ldquo;Statistics...&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Statistics dialog box, you&amp;rsquo;ll see information about the values in the field whose heading you clicked.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image16.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the statistics, e.g. minimum, maximum, mean, etc. The sum is the sum of the row values in the Enrollment field for all the schools, i.e. the total number of students in all schools &amp;ndash; 231,981 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the statistics box. Using Select by Attributes, select only the private schools. There should be 173 schools selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reopen the statistics for the Enrollment field. Note the Statistics tool operates only on selected rows (if any are selected). You can see the sum for enrollment for private schools is 15,860 &amp;ndash; this is the total number of students in private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-selected-features-in-another-selection-operation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Selected Features in Another Selection Operation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also select features from a set of features which are already selected, or alternatively, select a set of features from a set of selected source features. We&amp;rsquo;ll use two examples for illustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we will select features from a set of features &amp;ndash; charter schools (first selection) and enrollments over 1,000 students (second selection).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn on only the schools and neighborhoods layers (turn off the bike network layer). Put the neighborhoods layer on the bottom of the drawing list so you can see both schools and neighborhoods layers clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Select by Attributes, select only the charter schools. There should be 94 selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open the Select by Attribute dialog box again, but this time for Method: choose select from current selection. Then, of those selected schools, select those with enrollments greater than 1,000. There should be 15 schools selected, which are both charter schools and with enrollments greater than 1,000 students.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image22.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we will select a set of features from a set of selected source features &amp;ndash; the neighborhoods that contain the selected schools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the schools attribute table, but keep the 15 charter schools selected.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image23.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open Select By Location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Selection method: choose select features from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Target layer(s) check the box for the neighborhoods layer and uncheck all other boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Source layer: choose the schools layer. Then check the Use selected features box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Spatial selection method for target layer feature(s): choose contain the source layer feature.
&amp;gt; This spatial relationship operator allows you to select based on spatial containment &amp;ndash; whether on feature contains another feature &amp;ndash; i.e. if a neighborhood contains a currently selected school. (Make sure the Apply a search distance box is NOT checked)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press OK.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image24.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be 10 out of 48 neighborhoods selected.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image25.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-new-map-layer-from-a-selection-of-features&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a New Map Layer from a Selection of Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently, you will want to save your selected subset of features as a separate, standalone data file. For instance, you may want to select a set of schools based some enrollment criteria, and save this smaller number of schools as its own data file, not simply as a selection within the original schools data file. Generally, as you proceed through a GIS analysis, it is helpful to regularly save your selected features in separate data file.  You will have occasion to create new data files over and over again this term, and you must pay attention to where you are storing this data &lt;strong&gt;every single time&lt;/strong&gt;. ArcGIS tries very hard to get you to save your data:
+ in the &amp;ldquo;Geodatabase&amp;rdquo; format; and
+ in a default location on your local hard drive.
+ Additionally, it usually gives you unhelpful default file names, like &amp;ldquo;Export_Output&amp;rdquo;.
Therefore, if you don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention when you do this step, you will end up with a file name that is unintelligible, in a format that you don&amp;rsquo;t want, in a location that you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to find. Do not do
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example of how to save a selected set of data to its own file, we will export the 10 selected neighborhoods from the last step in the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the neighborhoods layer is on and you have 10 neighborhoods selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TOC, right-click on the neighborhoods layer, then choose Data &amp;gt; Export Data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Export: choose Selected features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Output feature class: click on the yellow folder icon and navigate to your Lab1 workspace folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Save as type: choose Shapefile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Name: enter my_neighborhoods (or, whatever you want to name this file &amp;ndash; whether or not you leave .shp at the end doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter).
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image26.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Save. You&amp;rsquo;re actually not done yet, as this just pushes your settings to the Export Data dialog box. Click OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dialog box will appear asking whether you want to add your new layer to the current map. Click Yes. The layer will now appear in TOC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clear your selection so no schools or neighborhoods are selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off the neighborhoods layer. You should be able to see the my_neighborhoods layer contains only those 10 formerly selected neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;designing-and-exporting-a-map&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing and Exporting a Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section we will see how to create a map layout and export the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-in-layout-view&#34;&gt;Working in Layout View&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been working in a view called &amp;ldquo;Data View&amp;rdquo;, which is most useful for data exploration and analysis. When producing maps for export, we need to switch to &amp;ldquo;Layout View&amp;rdquo;. In this view, you will see a representation of a page, and the map (or maps) will appear on that page. By default, the page will be a standard 8½ by 11 inch page in portrait view. In Layout View you can also add other elements, such as titles, textboxes, and legends. It is possible to place elements &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; the page (in an area known as the &amp;ldquo;pasteboard&amp;rdquo; in desktop publishing lingo). Anything not on the page will not be included on the map when you export the image, so it can be a useful place to store items during the design process when you are trying out different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn off the bike network layer and turn on all the other layers.  Put them in the following drawing order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schools (top)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My_neighborhoods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neighborhoods (bottom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you are viewing the full extent of your data (press the full extent button to be sure). Your canvas should look something like this (your colors may be different):
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image27.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch to Layout View in one of the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Layout View button in the lower-left of the map canvas:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image28.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select View &amp;gt; Layout View from the menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you can toggle back and forth between the layout and data view windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you switched views a new toolbar likely appeared: the Layout toolbar.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image29.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
Recall that if it did not you can click up in the grey area to add it in manually.  This toolbar has pan and zoom tools, similar to the ones you have used before, but these will zoom into the page (not the map). Notice that each of these icons has a page behind it (e.g. magnifier on a page) to distinguish it from the pan and zoom tools on the Tools toolbar. Experiment with these tools to move around the page. When you are done, hit Zoom Whole Page (the fourth button on the Layout toolbar).
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image30.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pan and zoom buttons on the Tools toolbar can be used to resize the map image on the page. Use the Zoom In button to make sure that Philadelphia fills most of the data frame. Note that if you zoom in too far, parts of Philadelphia will be &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; the data frame, and will not appear on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard map elements are standard for a reason.  Although it is possible to break the rules, you should know what you are doing before you snub 200+ years of cartographic theory.  Use the Insert menu to add the following elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title&amp;mdash;Should default to top center, can be repositioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legend&amp;mdash;A dialog will appear offering many options for customizing the legend. Just keep hitting Next until the legend appears on your map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;North Arrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale Bar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reposition the map elements to fill the white space. Try not to have any elements overlaying the Philadelphia neighborhoods. Your final layout may look something like this, but do &lt;em&gt;~NOT~&lt;/em&gt; try to make it look the same. Just make sure it has all the requested elements:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/image32.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have completed your map, save your .mxd document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;exporting-a-map-image&#34;&gt;Exporting a Map Image&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A finished map product can be exported into an image file that can be inserted into a MS Word document for your lab reports, or into web pages or other documents. This takes no extra effort compared to a screen shot, and is infinity more professional looking.  &lt;strong&gt;We will not accept screen shots of the ArcMap program, unless the directions specifically request a screen shot.&lt;/strong&gt;  Here, as an example we will export the map using the PNG format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to File → Export Map.&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set the Save as type to \&amp;ldquo;PNG (*.png)\&amp;ldquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to your lab1 folder. As always, be clear about where you are saving your files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Press Save.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;submission&#34;&gt;Submission&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you have to turn into blackboard for this week is the final image you created above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Labs in the intermediate class are a fair bit more involved than their intro to GIS counterparts.  Judicious use of the table of contents to the right to navigate will save your scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-2-cartographic-modeling&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 2 - Cartographic Modeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lab will introduce local operations using cartographic modeling (map algebra).  Part 1 is intended to show you how you can organize and display raster datasets in a usable format.  Part 2 will walk you through how to calculate NDWI and perform a water area analysis.  Part 3 you will model the geographic distribution of Kudzu in the conterminous United States and then compare your model to the actual geographic distribution, using Map Algebra and attribute table manipulation.  I&amp;rsquo;ve prefaced each lab with the learning objectives of the exercise, what you need to submit to blackboard, a set of materials for the lab as appropriate, and then the instructions for the lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-submit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to submit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Lake delineation and water classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Based on the results from 1995, which water delineation metric would you choose to perform this analysis, NDWI or MNDWI.  Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the area of the lake in 1995?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Calculate the area of the lake for 2003 and 2009.  Finish the table below and create a short graph of the area through time.  Create a short map of the before/after.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Composite images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Create another graph as was performed above&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 5&lt;/strong&gt;: What are some potential issues of using gap-filled imagery for scientific analysis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: Kudzu Suitability Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question 6&lt;/strong&gt;: The minimum annual precipitation for Kudzu to survive is:________&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question 7&lt;/strong&gt;: The minimum frost free day for Kudzu to survive is:________&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Question 8&lt;/strong&gt;: The total area (in m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) suitable for Kudzu to survive (according to your model) is:________  (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 9&lt;/strong&gt;: Complete the following table:
&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:black;}

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34; colspan=&#34;2&#34; rowspan=&#34;2&#34;&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-c3ow&#34; colspan=&#34;2&#34;&gt;Actual Kudzu Distribution&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-c3ow&#34;&gt;No Kudzu&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-baqh&#34;&gt;Kudzu&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-c3ow&#34; rowspan=&#34;2&#34;&gt;Your Model&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-c3ow&#34;&gt;No Kudzu&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-dvpl&#34;&gt;D:(00)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-lqy6&#34;&gt;B:(10)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-c3ow&#34;&gt;Kudzu&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-dvpl&#34;&gt;C:(01)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-lqy6&#34;&gt;A:(11)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assess the accuracy of your model by filling in the following information.  For more about confusion matrices look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix&#34;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accuracy - ((A+D)/(A+B+C+D)):&lt;br /&gt;
False Positive Rate - (C/(A+C)):&lt;br /&gt;
False Omission Rate - (B/(A+B)):&lt;br /&gt;
MCC - (A*D-B*C)/sqrt((A+B)*(A+C)*(D+B)*(D+C)):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 10&lt;/strong&gt;: Discuss some of the reasons for the inaccuracy of your model. In particular, examine why the error may be occurring. Also, looking at your kudzu_model layer, where geographically do you think this error is?  (Hint: Consider the factors that your model did not include that could explain the geography of the model’s error)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-lake-delineation-and-water-classification&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Lake delineation and water classification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-the-mxd&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up the MXD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new ArcMap document.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, a few housekeeping items.  Let’s take the training wheels off ArcMap and make sure we can overwrite data.  Click Geoprocessing &amp;gt; Geoprocessing Options and make sure the top two boxes in this window are selected.  You may also want to increase the time period results are stored to a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the 1995 year, add in the green, NIR, MIR, and MTL bands/images (Hint: &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LT05_C01_T1&#34;&gt;https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LT05_C01_T1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint#1: When performing the NDWI calculation, we refer to bands based their wavelength (e.g. green, NIR).  However, when distributing data the bands are referred to by their number based on sensor properties (so in our case, LANDSAT 5 TM has 7 bands and change).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Hint#2: A note about pyramids:  You will want to build pyramids when you add raster images into ArcMap.  You will notice that when this is done, ArcMap will create a file with a .ovr extension (look using the Windows file browser).  We&amp;rsquo;ll talk about pyramids in class more, but as a cursory introduction, think about Google Maps.  When you zoom out to look at the entire planet, there is no physical way to represent 30 meters on the screen.  Instead, we take a generalization of all the pixels underneath the region and display those values in their place.  Because Google sets the standards for mapping, there are generally 21 levels of images that are loaded in, with the top most layer being zoom level 1, and increasing as you zoom in.  See an interactive example of this concept in action at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/&#34;&gt;https://www.maptiler.com/google-maps-coordinates-tile-bounds-projection/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/media/Lab02Picture01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select all 4 images using shift-click, and right click &amp;gt; Group to place them in a group.  Slow click and rename this group to LS1995&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/media/Lab02Picture02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s find our lake using the go to xy tool and copy/pasting the lat/long in: -9.3970552,-77.3802742

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-an-area-of-interest-aoi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating An Area of Interest (AOI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Skill review from &lt;a href=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/lab04/#part-2-on-screen-digitizing&#34;&gt;Lab 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We next need to create a shape representing the area of analysis.  First, right click on your BaseData folder and create a new File Geodatabase.  Rename the database to &lt;em&gt;LakePalcacocha.gdb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the new geodatabase and go to New &amp;gt; Feature Class&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the Feature Class AOI and set the type to polygon.  Click next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll to the bottom of the window, expand the Layers folder, and click on the only option (WGS_1984_UTM_Zone_18N | WKID: 32618).  Click through the rest of the setup dialog to finish creating the shapefile.  Assuming you were successful you should now have a new layer called AOI in your TOC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an editing session (Editor toolbar &amp;gt; Editor &amp;gt; Start editing)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you are editing the AOI layer/LakePalcacocha.gdb database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the editor toolbar, click create features&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on AOI to bring up the construction tools&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Circle tool to create a small circle that encompasses the entirety of the lake.  It is alright for our purposes if we include land area, but do not make it so large that it might include nearby lakes.  This should look something like so:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/media/Lab02Picture03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the editor and stop editing.  Save your edits when it prompts you to.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculating-ndwi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating NDWI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The NWDI is defined as the normalized difference of the Green and Near Infrared bands of the Thematic Mapper.  (See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01431169608948714&#34;&gt;McFeeters paper in the International Journal Of Remote Sensing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
$$NDWI = \frac{Green-NIR}{Green+NIR}$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will use the raster calculator tool to accomplish this. At this point we can also use the environmental settings to clip our data so we don’t process the whole scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Geoprocessing &amp;gt; Environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under workspace, point the Current and Scratch workspaces to our LakePalcacocha.gdb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under processing extent, set the extent to “Same as Layer AOI”.  Click OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the search bar to pull up the Raster Calculator and use the prompts to calculate the NDWI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extension warnings?  Did you take the time to read it?  Warnings are a chance to learn something and in this case you should learn that you need to turn on spatial analysis under Customize &amp;gt; Extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go ahead and try to enter in the expression above.  Save the resulting raster using the folder icon under the Output Raster dialog box, click on the name of one of the other bands (to preserve the LANDSAT naming convention), and change the end of the file to &lt;em&gt;…NDWI.tif&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that the resulting raster has a value of 0, and is entirely empty.  This is because ArcMap likes to save memory and forces raster calculations to integers.  Fixing this just means we need to be more verbose and run the calculations as floats using Float() under the Math section.  This conversion to integer occurs in both the numerator and denominator, so the float needs to wrap both of them separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Geoprocessing &amp;gt; Results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you double click on the last tool run, it will open the tool prompt as it was run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the expression to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;&lt;em&gt;Float(&amp;ldquo;LT05…B 2.TIF&amp;rdquo; -  &amp;ldquo;LT05…B4.TIF&amp;rdquo;) / Float(&amp;ldquo;LT05…B2.TIF&amp;rdquo; + &amp;ldquo;LT05…B4.TIF&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculating-mndwi&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating MNDWI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The MNWDI is defined as the normalized difference of the Green and Near Infrared bands of the Thematic Mapper.  (See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01431160600589179&#34;&gt;Xu paper, also in the International Journal Of Remote Sensing&lt;/a&gt;)
$$MNDWI = \frac{Green-MIR}{Green+MIR}$$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because this process is so similar to the NDWI (we use band 5, not band 4), it is easiest to pull the results up from our last raster calculator and change a few characters.  Change all 4’s to 5’s and change the output file name to MNDWI.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to geoprocessing &amp;gt; Results and double click on the last tool run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;classifying-and-quantifying-the-change-in-water-surface-area&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classifying and quantifying the change in water surface area&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ve probably noticed by now, but the NDWI and MNDWI calculations return an image with valid values from -1 to 1, but this doesn’t tell us what is and is not water.  To do that we need to classify the image into a binary water/not water schema.  There are a variety of ways to do this that range in sophistication/robustness, but for our purposes, a simple threshold will suffice.  This means we want classify all pixels with a NDWI/MNDWI value greater than or less than some value into water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the identify button and poke around the image to find a good threshold.  I settled on 0.30&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the raster calculator to select the cells greater than 0.30, and append the name of the NDWI layer with the threshold value (_…NDWI&lt;em&gt;3.tif&lt;/em&gt;).
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/media/Lab02Picture04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
Examine the outputs (right click on the resulting layer and see the attribute table.)  You now have enough information to answer Questions 1 - 3 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-composite-image&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a composite image&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the downfalls that plague many passive remote sensing platforms is the inability to penetrate cloud cover.  Notice that although we didn’t happen to encounter cloud obfuscation in the first part of this lab, clouds are not uncommon.  Let’s use water year 2005 as an example.  I’ve taken the liberty of downloading and setting up your ArcMap document and data for you.  Just download the Map package and double click to open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because land/water has a lower reflectance across all bands as opposed to clouds, one of the simplest and most effective means of filtering out cloud cover is to take the local minimum from a raster stack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArcMap has a tool called &lt;strong&gt;Cell Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; which performs statistics for local operations.  Either use the search tool or find it in Spatial Analyst Tools &amp;gt; local.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to calculate the minimum of each band within the 4 seasons.  Using band 4 for the winter as an example, the inputs should look like so:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog558/media/Lab02Picture05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have gone ahead and taken the minimum of 3 of the 4 seasons. So you only need to calculate the minimums for the spring months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the NDWI calculation, thresholding, and area measurement as was performed above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer questions 4 and 5 in the handout.  Save and close Arcmap, we’re done looking at the lake for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;establishing-the-model-parameters&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishing the model parameters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start ArcMap and add &lt;i&gt;sanpre25k&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;usfrost25k&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;sample1&lt;/i&gt; from your lab02\Part03 folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;extracting data for building Kudzu distribution model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the attribute table for &lt;em&gt;sample1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The numbers in the “KUDZU” field represent presence or absence of Kudzu at that point (1 for presence, 0 for absence)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You want to find the minimum annual precipitation (in mm) and the minimum frost-free days at each of these points. This information will be your source of input for modeling potential Kudzu distribution across the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the attribute table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArcToolbox contains an &lt;strong&gt;Extract values to points&lt;/strong&gt; tool that will add the value of a raster to a set of points. It then creates a new point file with an attribute holding that raster value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Spatial Analyst Toolbox &amp;gt;Extraction &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Extract values to points&lt;/strong&gt; tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This tool requires three inputs and has two optional ones. You can find out more information about each of the inputs (this applies to other ArcTools as well) by clicking on the Show Help button and then clicking on the field of interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your Input point features to sample1 (You can either use the drop-down that shows all the point layers in the ArcMap Table of Contents or the Browse file button to navigate to the file).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your Input raster to &lt;em&gt;usanpre25k&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set Output point features so that it saves the new file called sample1precip to your lab02\Part03 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK (Be patient. This may take a while.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your new point file will appear in the ArcMap Table of Contents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the attribute table for &lt;em&gt;sample1precip&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice the new variable called RASTERVALU that contains the annual precipitation amount for that point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat the above steps&lt;/strong&gt; to create a similar point file containing a RASTERVALU attribute for frost-free days at each point. Call it &lt;em&gt;sample1frost&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, there is an &lt;strong&gt;Extract multi values to points&lt;/strong&gt; tool, which will do this whole process at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By looking at the minimum precipitation and minimum number of frost-free days that Kudzu required for survival in the sample points, we can model (predict) its potential geographic expansion across the U.S. In order to do this, we need to get this information out of the datasets we just created.  To find the minimum annual precipitation and minimum number of frost-free days required for Kudzu to survive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the attribute tables of your samples and perform an attribute query to select only those points with known Kudzu presence (“KUDZU” = 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show only the selected records using the table toggle button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort in ascending order the RASTERVALU field (R-Click on column heading).
Answer #6 and #7 on your answer sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-the-model&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Running the model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new grids based on the usanpre25k and usfrost25k grid using Raster Calculator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;usanpre25k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;= minimum value&lt;/mark&gt;** (**Minimum Value in question 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;usanpre25k&lt;/i&gt;, the new grid cells with an annual precipitation greater than or equal to the minimum annual precipitation will have a value of 1, while cells with an annual precipitation less than the minimum value will have a value of 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the grid as precipitation in your lab02\part03 folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;usfrost25k&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt;= minimum value&lt;/mark&gt;** (**Minimum Value in question 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;usfrost25k&lt;/i&gt;, the new grid cells with a frost-free-days greater than or equal to the minimum frost-free-days will have a value of 1, while cells with a frost-free-days less than the minimum frost-free-days will have a value of 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the grid as frost in your lab02\part03 folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict the Kudzu U.S. distribution by multiplying the precipitation and frost grids. Save the output grid as &lt;i&gt;kudzu_model&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Answer #8 on your answer sheet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;assessing-the-model&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing the model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;i&gt;sample2&lt;/i&gt; to your ArcMap Table of Contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Extract values to points tool you now want to create a new point shapefile called &lt;i&gt;sample2check&lt;/i&gt; that will have an attribute of actual presence (KUDZU) and one for predicted presence (RASTERVALU found by using &lt;i&gt;kudzu_model&lt;/i&gt; as raster input)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have created &lt;i&gt;sample2check&lt;/i&gt; you can quantify your accuracy in one of many ways.  Here are two suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a new field named check and perform the following calculation: &lt;mark&gt;&lt;em&gt;check = [RASTERVALU] * 10 + [KUDZU]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;.  The Check field should have the following outputs: 0, 1, 10, and 11 (0 and 1 represent 00 and 01 respectively)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform attribute query using the AND operator 4 times, once for each possible combination.  (i.g. &lt;mark&gt;&lt;em&gt;KUDZU = 1 AND RASTERVALUE = 0&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete #9 and #10 on your assignment sheet and TURN IT IN; your grade on this lab will be based entirely on your answers to the questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This data is in a zipped format.  You are able to tell this because the folder will have a small zipper going down it&amp;rsquo;s side, and if you click into it, the top of the file explorer will have a pink bar with &amp;ldquo;Compressed Folder Tools&amp;rdquo; on the top.  To access it you will need to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the folder with the zipped download&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the folder and chose 7-zip &amp;gt; &amp;ldquo;extract to &lt;em&gt;your folder name here&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcMap and close any windows that pop up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; the empty map document to a personal folder, name it something meaningful like GEOG358_Lab02_YourLastName.mxd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Add Data&lt;/strong&gt; button, navigate to your downloaded data folder, hold down the Control key and click &lt;em&gt;conusa.shp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities.shp&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;latlong.shp&lt;/em&gt;, and then click &lt;strong&gt;Add&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;measuring-in-arcmap&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measuring in ArcMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;measure-locations-in-latitude-and-longitude&#34;&gt;Measure Locations in Latitude and Longitude&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click &lt;strong&gt;Layers&lt;/strong&gt; in the Table of Contents and select &lt;strong&gt;Properties&lt;/strong&gt;. Under the &lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; tab, change the &lt;strong&gt;Name&lt;/strong&gt; to U.S. Cities. A little lower in the tab, under the &lt;strong&gt;Units&lt;/strong&gt; heading, make sure Display set to Decimal Degrees. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick-and-dirty way to estimate the latitude and longitude of a point is to hover the &lt;strong&gt;Select Elements&lt;/strong&gt; tool over the point and then look at the numbers in the bottom right part of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Full Extent&lt;/strong&gt; button to put the entire map into focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use this technique on Los Angeles, Chicago, and Lawrence. Answer question 1 on the assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: did you look in the data downloads folder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now let’s use a more accurate method to determine the latitude and longitude of those cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Identify&lt;/strong&gt; button and then click on Lawrence. In the window that pops up, click Lawrence under &lt;em&gt;selectuscities&lt;/em&gt;. About an inch below are the city’s coordinates (listed after Location:). Use this method to answer question #2 on your assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless your quick-and-dirty estimations were dead-on, you should see a small discrepancy between the coordinates in question #1 and question #2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;comparing-distances-in-different-projections&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing distances in different projections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the data frame’s &lt;strong&gt;Properties&lt;/strong&gt; window. Select the &lt;strong&gt;Coordinate System&lt;/strong&gt; tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the upper box, navigate to Projected Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; Continental &amp;gt; North America, click USA Contiguous Lambert Conformal Conic, make note of the map in the window, and then click Apply at the bottom of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now the map is no longer (as) distorted!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;Measure&lt;/strong&gt; tool. In the Measure window, make sure &lt;strong&gt;Distance&lt;/strong&gt; is set to &lt;strong&gt;Miles&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Measurement Type&lt;/strong&gt; (the rightmost down arrow) is set to Planar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hover the Measure tool over Lawrence. The cursor should snap to Lawrence and a circle should appear around the city. (If this doesn’t happen, click the Select Elements button, then click the Measure tool and try again.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Lawrence and then hover over Chicago. As with Lawrence, the cursor should snap to the location and a circle should appear around it. This is your distance measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using this technique, answer question #3 on your assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;changing-the-map-projection&#34;&gt;Changing the map projection&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;Properties&lt;/strong&gt; window, select the &lt;strong&gt;Coordinate System&lt;/strong&gt; tab, and navigate to Projected Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; UTM &amp;gt; NAD 1983, click NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15N, and click Apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you did before, measure the distance from Lawrence to Chicago and from Lawrence to New York City. (Make sure the Measure tool is set to Miles and the Planar distance.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer questions #4 and #5 on your assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;defining-the-coordinate-system-for-a-shapefile-using-arctoolbox&#34;&gt;Defining the coordinate system for a shapefile using ArcToolbox&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;ArcToolbox&lt;/strong&gt; button (it looks like a red toolbox with a computer window in the background). Give it a minute to open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Data Management Tools &amp;gt; Projections and Transformations, and then double-click &lt;strong&gt;Define Projection&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re going to use this tool to assign a geographic coordinate system (GCS) to the &lt;em&gt;kscities&lt;/em&gt; shapefile in our data folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the folder icon &lt;strong&gt;—not the down arrow—&lt;/strong&gt; to the right of Input Dataset or Feature Class. Add your &lt;em&gt;kscities.shp&lt;/em&gt; to the map by navigating to your data folder, selecting &lt;em&gt;kscities.shp&lt;/em&gt; and clicking Add. Notice the warning that pops up that indicates that the Coordinate System is Unknown.  This is what we’re going to fix!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click  on the pointing hand icon to right of Coordinate System.  Just like we did in previous steps, select the following: Geographic Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; North America &amp;gt; NAD 1983.  Don’t click OK just yet.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice the components of the GCS, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name: GCS_North American_1983&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angular Units: Degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prime Meridian: Greenwich&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Datum: D_North American_1983&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semimajor Axis: 6378137&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Semiminor Axis: 6356752
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now click OK. Click OK again. Notice that kscities has been added to the Table of Contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You can also define the coordinate system for a shapefile in ArcCatalog. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcCatalog, right click on the shapefile and select Properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the XY Coordinate System tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest will be similar as in ArcToolbox.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-kscities-shp-into-kansas-state-plane-coordinate-system-pcs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project kscities.shp into Kansas State Plane Coordinate System (PCS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;ArcToolbox&lt;/strong&gt; go to Data Management Tools &amp;gt; Projections and Transformations, and then double-click &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt;. This tool is different than the Define Projection tool we just used; it actually creates a new shapefile that is projected into the desired coordinate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Input Dataset or Feature Class section, click the down-arrow &lt;strong&gt;—not the folder icon—&lt;/strong&gt; and select &lt;em&gt;kscities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the folder icon to the right of Output Dataset or Feature Class. Navigate to your data folder. In the Name field type &lt;em&gt;kscities_stateplane.shp&lt;/em&gt; and then click &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the pointing hand icon to the right of Output Coordinate System and then select the following coordinate system and make note that you can see its parameters: Projected Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; State Plane &amp;gt; NAD 1983 (Meters) &amp;gt; NAD 1983 StatePlane Kansas North FIPS 1501 (Meters).prj&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK. Click OK again. The projected shapefile will be added to your Table of Contents automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-a-map&#34;&gt;Make a map!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off all layers except &lt;em&gt;conusa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click &lt;em&gt;conusa&lt;/em&gt; and select Zoom to Layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities&lt;/em&gt;, go to Selection, and select Make This The Only Selectable Layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Select Features button (it looks like a cursor in front of a tiny map).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draw a box around Lawrence. Now Lawrence is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities&lt;/em&gt;, go to Selection, and select Create Layer from Selected Features. Now you have a layer of just Lawrence called &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities&lt;/em&gt; selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click once in the middle of the &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities&lt;/em&gt; selection layer name and type Lawrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the &lt;em&gt;selecteduscities&lt;/em&gt; layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the Lawrence layer and select Properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Symbology tab, you should see a big Symbol button with a dot in the middle of it. Click it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Symbol Selector window that pops up, scroll down a bit until you see the symbol
Star 1. Click that symbol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To the right is a Size box. Type 30 in the box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Color button above it and select a color that you think represents Lawrence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch to Layout View (accessible via the View menu or a little button in the bottom left corner of the window).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a map. All you need to include is the mapped area, a title (e.g., “Lawrence, Kansas”), and your name. Spend a couple minutes making it pretty. Since the contiguous
U.S. is wider than it is tall, a landscape orientation is recommended. Also, make sure to zoom in close enough so that there isn’t an excessive amount of space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export the map as a .png file called GEOG_358_Lab02_YourLastName.png.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;real-world-application&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Real World&amp;rdquo; Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States Border Patrol&amp;rsquo;s jurisdiction is divided into Regions and further subdivided into Sectors. In the Western Region, the San Diego and El Centro Sectors are responsible for patrolling approximately 130 miles of border between the State of California and Mexico. The San Diego Sector, headquartered in Chula Vista, California, has used GIS for several years. The El Centro Sector, east of San Diego, is in the process of implementing a GIS and is working closely with the San Diego Sector. Both Sectors are committed to standardizing GIS data collection, symbology, and analysis. Through data sharing exercises, the Border Patrol staff noticed that two similar sets of street data, one from the El Centro Sector office and another from the San Diego Sector office, were not aligning.  They have asked you to figure out what datum the data is in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;getting-started-1&#34;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up a new ArcMap window.  Click &lt;strong&gt;Cancel&lt;/strong&gt; on the opening screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the map document in your data folder as &lt;em&gt;GEOG358_Lab02_YourLastNameApplication.mxd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, there is only one data frame in the Table of Contents. For this exercise, though, we want three data frames. Go to &lt;strong&gt;Insert &amp;gt; DataFrame&lt;/strong&gt; and create two more data frames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename the data frames as:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unknown Coordinate Systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GCS NAD83&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PCS NAD27&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on each shapefile in the ArcCatolog window and determine the datum the shapefile is in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort the shapefiles to their appropriate data frames. (For example, we will add the shapefiles without coordinate system information to the Unknown Coordinate Systems data frame.) Right-click each data frame, select &lt;strong&gt;Add Data…&lt;/strong&gt;, and add the appropriate shapefile(s).
&amp;gt; Make sure you are adding shapefiles and not layer files [.lyr])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are presented with a window that complains about an Unknown Spatial Reference, just press OK; this is the problem we are trying to fix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;strong&gt;Unknown Coordinate Systems&lt;/strong&gt; data frame and select &lt;strong&gt;Activate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click the &lt;strong&gt;Unknown Coordinate Systems&lt;/strong&gt; data frame. Under the &lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; tab, set the map units to &lt;strong&gt;Decimal Degrees&lt;/strong&gt; and the display units to &lt;strong&gt;Meters&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Apply&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you’re zoomed in enough by right-clicking the SanDiego layer and selecting &lt;strong&gt;Zoom To Layer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the map for a couple seconds and try not to develop a migraine. That offset between layers suggests datum problems. The &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; layer is probably in one datum and the &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt; layer in another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;investigate-the-san-diego-and-el-centro-datum-problem&#34;&gt;Investigate the San Diego and El Centro datum problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; layer, select &lt;strong&gt;Copy&lt;/strong&gt;, right-click the &lt;em&gt;GCS NAD83&lt;/em&gt; data frame, and select &lt;strong&gt;Paste&lt;/strong&gt; Layer(s). Do the same for the &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt; layer. The &lt;em&gt;GCS NAD83&lt;/em&gt; data frame should have four layers now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;em&gt;GCS NAD83&lt;/em&gt; data frame and select &lt;strong&gt;Activate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;em&gt;StudyArea&lt;/em&gt; layer and select &lt;strong&gt;Zoom To Layer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;StudyArea&lt;/em&gt; layers by going to the Table of Contents by clicking the checkboxes next to them. The only visible layer should be &lt;em&gt;cards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s see if either the &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; layer or the &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt; layer might have been created using the same datum as the cards layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom in closer to one of the roads in the middle part of the cards layer. Now turn the &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt; on and off a few times. Does one of them seem to fit the cards layer better? If you don’t see any difference, look closer at the highway interchange in the right part of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;define-the-coordinate-systems-for-san-diego-and-el-centro-street-shapefiles&#34;&gt;Define the coordinate systems for San Diego and El Centro street shapefiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re going to remove all the &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; layers from our map document. Right-click each one (there should be four of them total) and select Remove.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;ArcToolbox&lt;/strong&gt; icon and give it a few seconds to open. Go to Data Management Tools &amp;gt; Projections and Transformations and then double-click &lt;strong&gt;Define Projection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the folder icon to the right of Input Dataset or Feature Class and select
&lt;em&gt;SanDiego.shp&lt;/em&gt; from your folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the hand icon to the right of Coordinate System and select Geographic Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; North America &amp;gt; NAD 1983. Click OK. Click OK again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This shapefile will automatically be added to the active data frame (GCS NAD83).
&amp;gt; note: If you received an error message from stating that projection didn’t work, make sure ArcCatalog is closed and try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click the &lt;em&gt;SanDiego&lt;/em&gt; layer you just created and then click the &lt;strong&gt;Source&lt;/strong&gt; tab. It should list the Geographic Coordinate System as &lt;em&gt;GCS_North_American_1983&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; tab and rename the layer &lt;em&gt;SanDiego_GCS_NAD83&lt;/em&gt;. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; shapefile might be in GCS NAD27.  Using the &lt;strong&gt;Define Projection&lt;/strong&gt; process we just used, select the following coordinate system for ElCentro: Geographic Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; North America &amp;gt; NAD 1927.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename the layer &lt;em&gt;ElCentro_GCS_NAD27&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; layer certainly fits much better now, but that’s not good enough for purists like us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;convert-el-centro-street-shapefile-from-nad27-to-nad83&#34;&gt;Convert El Centro street shapefile from NAD27 to NAD83&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;ArcToolbox&lt;/strong&gt; go to Data Management Tools &amp;gt; Projections and Transformations and then double-click &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the down-arrow to the right of Input Dataset or Feature Class and select &lt;em&gt;ElCentro_GCS_NAD27&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the folder to the right of Output Dataset or Feature Class and save the file in your folder as &lt;em&gt;ElCentro_GCS_NAD83.shp&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the hand icon to the right of Output Coordinate System and select Geographic Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; North America &amp;gt; NAD 1983.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the box below the Geographic Transformation (optional) field says &lt;em&gt;NAD_1927_To_NAD_1983_NADCON&lt;/em&gt;.
&amp;gt; If it doesn’t, click the down-arrow to the right of Geographic Transformation (optional) and select NAD_1927_To_NAD&lt;em&gt;1983&lt;/em&gt; NADCON.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK. This layer will be added to the active data frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reproject-the-usgs100k-shapefile&#34;&gt;Reproject the Usgs100k shapefile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Usgs100k&lt;/em&gt; layer in the &lt;em&gt;PCS NAD27&lt;/em&gt; data frame is a 1:100,000 scale digital line graph (DLG) that was downloaded from the USGS EROS website. It is in a projected coordinate system (NAD_1927_UTM_Zone_11N).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproject this layer the same way you reprojected the &lt;em&gt;ElCentro&lt;/em&gt; layer in the last section. When you’re done, drag the layer over to the &lt;em&gt;GCS NAD83&lt;/em&gt; data frame. How well does it fit the other layers? You may notice that the fit is better in the area’s center compared to its periphery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-some-pre-made-layer&#34;&gt;Add some pre-made layer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esri’s ArcGIS Resource Center defines a layer thusly: “Each layer references a dataset and specifies how that dataset is portrayed using symbols and text labels. When you add a layer to a map, you specify its dataset and set its map symbols and labeling properties.” We’re going to add a few layers that already have their map symbols and labeling properties set but need to be referenced back to their shapefiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the GCS NAD83 data frame still active, right-click the data frame and select Turn All Layers Off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the data frame, select Add Data, and add the following:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cards.lyr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ElCentro.lyr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SanDiego.lyr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t see anything? That’s because the connection to the underlying data was severed. This is the case whenever you see grayed-out check boxes with red exclamation marks next to them. Let’s fix this. For each layer, double-click the layer, click the Source tab, click the  Set Data Source… button, and then add its corresponding shapefile from your Lab04 folder (e.g., cards.shp for cards.lyr). This should make the gray part of the check boxes and the red exclamation marks disappear.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a screen shot of ArcMap (all of it—including the Table of Contents, menus, etc., using the snip tool is fine in this case) and save it in your data folder as GEOG358_Lab2Application.png.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paste the image in the word document with the rest of your answers and submit it on blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-3-focal-operations-focal-operations-removing-dem-errors-wind-exposure-and-lake-edge-detection&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 3: Focal Operations – Focal Operations, Removing DEM Errors, Wind Exposure, and Lake Edge Detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objectives&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lab will use neighborhood operators (i.e. focal operators) to examine an elevation surface, remove errors in a DEM, analyze wind exposure, and delineate the edge of our lake classified in Lab 2.  In the first part, you will learn how to bring an ASCII into Arc as a grid and confirm your understanding of focal statistics.  In the second, you will use the slope tool and focal statistics to blur out errors in the DEM and examine how changing the window results in a changing image.  In Part 3, you will perform a site suitability analysis for wind turbines using the slope, aspect, hillshade, and focal wedge tools.  Finally, we will use focal erosion to isolate the edge of our lakes classified in Lab 2.  You can do all of these parts within the same or separate mxd’s, but be sure to save often.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;: What was the size of the patches used to mosaic the image? (approximately):  _______  Meters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Are the artifacts (errors) still visible in silver3x3 and silver7x7?:  _______ (true/false)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 4&lt;/strong&gt;: How many cells have an elevation greater than or equal to 1000m?:  _______ Cells&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 5&lt;/strong&gt;: How many cells have an aspect between 225&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and 315&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; (see your GoodAspect raster layer)?  _______ cells&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 6&lt;/strong&gt;: What is the total area (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of Good sites and blocked cells using a 10 cell radius (see your GoodSites10 raster layer)?&lt;br /&gt;
Good Sites:  _______ m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Blocked:  _______ m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 7&lt;/strong&gt;: Calculate wind exposure using a wedge radius of 4 cells (120 meters).  Use similar naming conventions (i.e: WindMean04, GoodWindExp04, GoodSites04, &amp;amp; Blocked04).  What is the total area (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the good sites and blocked cells?&lt;br /&gt;
Good Sites:  _______ m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Blocked:  _______ m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 8&lt;/strong&gt;: Calculate wind exposure using a wedge radius of 20 cells (600 meters).  Use similar naming conventions (i.e: WindMean20, GoodWindExp20, GoodSites20, &amp;amp; Blocked20).  What is the total area (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the good sites and blocked cells?&lt;br /&gt;
Good Sites:  _______ m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Blocked:  _______ m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Point&lt;/strong&gt;:  Why did increasing the radius value to 20 in question 8 cause the wedge neighborhood computation time to increase so dramatically? (look at the time spent in geoprocessing &amp;gt; results)  Be specific; only the best answers will get the full point!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 9&lt;/strong&gt;: Paste your final map here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Name the default data frame to ASCII Grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the workspace for the Spatial Analyst Tools by going to Geoprocessing &amp;gt; Environments…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Workspace change the Current Workspace to your Lab3 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename the data frame named ASCII Grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect the ASCII Grid file &lt;i&gt;test.txt&lt;/i&gt; using a text editor such as notepad. We will use this small raster file to visually verify the results of several focal operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcToolbox and Select Conversion Tools | To Raster | &lt;strong&gt;ASCII to Raster&lt;/strong&gt; tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set test.txt as the input file and save the output raster as test in your lab03\part01 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the data type to default and Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The test raster will be added to the Table of Contents automatically.  You can ignore any projection warnings you receive when adding these rasters.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;convert-dem-from-feet-to-meters&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convert DEM from feet to meters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s lay down the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert and rename a data frame to DEM Error Removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;i&gt;silvrsub_f&lt;/i&gt; grid to the data frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This surface was created in rectangular patches and then mosaiced together, but the artifacts of mosaicing are not readily visible by simply viewing the DEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since the height is in feet and the cell sizes are in meters, you should put everything into the same unit using a local operation (i.e., Raster Calculator).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output to your lab03\part02 folder as: &lt;i&gt;silversub_m&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;locate-artifacts-errors-in-the-dem&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locate Artifacts (Errors) in the DEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by calculating the slope for the raster to more easily identify the artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcToopbox | Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | &lt;strong&gt;Slope&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a focal operation we can use to find the linear artifacts in the &lt;i&gt;silversub_m&lt;/i&gt; grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the slope dialog box, set the input raster as &lt;i&gt;silversub_m&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the default values for output measurement and z factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output grid &lt;i&gt;silver_slope&lt;/i&gt; in your lab03\part02 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to visually pick out the linear artifacts left from the mosaicing process.  Using the measurement tool, determine the approximate size of the patches that were used to mosaic the image and answer Question #2 on your assignment sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;removing-dem-errors&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removing DEM Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now try to eliminate the artifacts by smoothing the surface of &lt;i&gt;silversub_m&lt;/i&gt; before deriving the slope.  Go to ArcToolbox | Spatial Analyst Tools | Neighborhood | &lt;strong&gt;Focal Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; to compute the mean elevation value in a rectangular neighborhood of 3x3 cells and another of 7x7 cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use silversub_m as the input in both cases, making sure to name the output appropriately, something like &lt;i&gt;silver3x3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;silver7x7&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derive the slopes of these new surfaces as in step 2, and be sure to name them appropriately, something like &lt;i&gt;slope3x3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;slope7x7&lt;/i&gt; respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer Question #3 on your assignment sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-3-wind-exposure-analysis&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 3: Wind Exposure Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;convert-dem-from-feet-to-meters-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convert DEM from feet to meters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s lay down the foundation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert a new dataframe and call it Wind Exposure Analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;i&gt;wnw&lt;/i&gt; grid to the data frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This surface was created in rectangular patches and then mosaiced together, but the artifacts of mosaicing are not readily visible by simply viewing the DEM.  Since the height is in feet and the cell sizes are in meters, you should put everything into the same unit, as was done in Part 2. Save the output to your lab03\part03 folder as: &lt;i&gt;wnm_m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-areas-with-good-elevation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obtaining Areas with Good Elevation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the cells where the elevation in &lt;i&gt;wnw_m&lt;/i&gt; is greater than or equal to 1000m by creating the following expression in the Raster Calculator: &lt;mark&gt;“wnw_m” &amp;gt;= 1000&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the output raster a permanent layer named &lt;i&gt;GoodElevation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;generating-a-hillshade-raster-layer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Generating a Hillshade raster layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Spatial Analyst, create a hillshade raster from your &lt;i&gt;wnw_m&lt;/i&gt; DEM using the ArcToolbox | Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | &lt;strong&gt;Hillshade&lt;/strong&gt; tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;i&gt;wnw_m&lt;/i&gt; as your input surface, leave the default settings for azimuth and altitude, but set the Z factor to 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output grid as &lt;i&gt;hillshade&lt;/i&gt; in your lab03\part03 folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;visualizing-with-hillshade&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualizing with hillshade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hiilshades are useful for providing geographic context, but can overwhelm data which kind of defeats the purpose of making a map.  One way to fix this is mask out no data values in your output layer, and make it slightly transparent.  We&amp;rsquo;ll do this a few times in this lab so remember this sequence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display &lt;i&gt;GoodElevation&lt;/i&gt; on top of &lt;i&gt;hillshade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the color of the bad elevations (0’s) to hollow (no color) by:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R-clicking on &lt;i&gt;GoodElivation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select symbology tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check box “display background value:”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proceed with: 0 symbol and selecting No Color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the Transparency value of &lt;i&gt;GoodElivation&lt;/i&gt; to approximately 40%

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R-Click -&amp;gt; Properties under the Display tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer Question #4 on your assignment sheet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-areas-with-good-aspect&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obtaining Areas with Good Aspect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the aspect from &lt;i&gt;wnw_m&lt;/i&gt; DEM using the ArcToolbox | Spatial Analyst Tools| Surface | &lt;strong&gt;Aspect&lt;/strong&gt; tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output grid as aspect in your lab03\part03 folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notice the range of angles assigned to each direction in the table of contents. Aspect values begin at 0 at due north and increase clockwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Raster Calculator, select the cells with an aspect between 225&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; and 315&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;. This will give us the westward facing slopes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That expression should look like &lt;mark&gt;(225 &amp;lt;= “aspect”) &amp;amp; (“aspect” &amp;lt;= 315)&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the output raster a layer named &lt;i&gt;GoodAspect&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the &lt;i&gt;GoodAspect&lt;/i&gt; on top of &lt;i&gt;hillshade&lt;/i&gt; (set symbology like you did for &lt;i&gt;GoodElivation&lt;/i&gt;) and verify that it represents the western slopes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answer Question #5 on your assignment sheet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;obtaining-wind-exposure-values&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obtaining Wind Exposure Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a neighbor mean raster of &lt;i&gt;wnw_m&lt;/i&gt; using a FocalMean operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ArcToolbox | Spatial Analyst Tools | Neighborhood | Focal Statistics with a wedge neighborhood (start angle 135, end angle 225, and a radius of 10 cells.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note here that the wedge neighborhood is measured differently than the aspect. The aspect measurement begins at 0 degrees due north and increases as we move clockwise. However, when computing a wedge neighborhood, we start at 0 degrees due east and increase as we move counterclockwise. Thus, the degree range here (135-225) represents the same degree range as indicated in the aspect range (225-315). This is simply due to inconsistencies in the way the ArcGIS software handles radial measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as &lt;i&gt;WindMean10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Raster Calculator, select the cells whose elevations are higher than their neighbor mean (i.e., &lt;em&gt;WindMean10&lt;/em&gt;)

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_wnw&lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;WindMean10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the output a permanent raster named &lt;i&gt;GoodWindExp10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display &lt;em&gt;GoodWindExp10&lt;/em&gt; on top of &lt;i&gt;hillshade&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;isolate-the-best-sites-and-those-that-meet-all-the-criteria-except-wind-exposure&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate the best sites and those that meet all the criteria except wind exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Raster Calculator, select the cells with good elevation (1’s), aspect (1’s), and wind exposure (1’s).  Your expression can look like: &lt;mark&gt;(&lt;em&gt;GoodElevation&lt;/em&gt; == 1) &amp;amp; (&lt;em&gt;GoodAspect&lt;/em&gt; == 1) &amp;amp; (&lt;em&gt;GoodWindExp10&lt;/em&gt; == 1)&lt;/mark&gt;, or more simply &lt;mark&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoodElevation&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;GoodAspect&lt;/em&gt; * &lt;em&gt;GoodWindExp10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the output a permanent raster named &lt;i&gt;GoodSites10&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Raster Calculator, select the cells with good elevation (1’s), good aspect (1’s) and bad wind exposure (0’s) with the following expression: &lt;mark&gt;(&lt;em&gt;GoodElevation&lt;/em&gt; == 1) &amp;amp; (&lt;em&gt;GoodAspect&lt;/em&gt; == 1) &amp;amp; (&lt;em&gt;GoodWindExp10&lt;/em&gt; == 0)&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make this a permanent raster named &lt;i&gt;Blocked10&lt;/i&gt;, which indicate cells where the wind is blocked because of hills to the west.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer questions #6 - #8 on your assignment sheet (you will need to repeat the steps above twice more using different radius values)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Using raster calculator, subtract the focal min raster from the lake classification raster using an expression such as: &lt;mark&gt;&amp;ldquo;1995\LT05&lt;em&gt;L1TP&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;_NDWI_3.TIF&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;1995\LT05&lt;em&gt;L1TP&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip;_NDWI_FMin.TIF&amp;rdquo;&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output of the map as &lt;i&gt;LT05_&amp;hellip;_LakeBoundry.TIF&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;perform-the-above-steps-for-both-2003-and-2009&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform the above steps for both 2003 and 2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Move to layout view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the page dimensions to 11 in x 11 (File, page and print setup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use guides to set up 3 inch grids (click on the guides)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right click on the data frames to copy them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paste them in the frame and rename them to the appropriate place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text can be rotated in the properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add grid lines, change the frame properties or using lines by adding the drawing toolbar (right click in the grey area as necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, export your map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-03-using-gps-for-field-data-collection&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 03: Using GPS for Field Data Collection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction
This exercise provides an introduction to using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to obtain coordinates and create a point shapefile. GPS is a system consisting of a network of satellites that orbit ~11,000 nautical miles from the earth in six different orbital paths. They are continuously monitored by ground stations located worldwide. The satellites transmit signals that can be detected with a GPS receiver. Using the receiver, you can determine your location with great precision through the trilateration (not triangulation!) of signals from at least 3 satellites, based on measurements of distance using the travel time of radio signals (which travel at the speed of light) from the satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the system is very sophisticated, and atomic clocks are used by the satellites, there are multiple sources and types of errors involved in finding your location. As the GPS signal passes through the charged particles of the ionosphere and then through the water vapor in the troposphere, this   causes the signal to slow a bit, and this creates the same kind of error as bad clocks. Also, if the satellites that are in your view at a particular moment are close together in the sky, the intersecting circles that define a position will cross at very shallow angles. That increases the error margin around a position. The kind of GPS receivers we will be using provide about 10 meter accuracy (which may be reduced to under 3m if differential corrections like WAAS are used), depending on the number of satellites available and the geometry of those satellites. If you want to learn more about GPS, I would recommend Garmin’s introduction (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.garmin.com/aboutGPS/manual.html&#34;&gt;http://www.garmin.com/aboutGPS/manual.html&lt;/a&gt;) or Trimble’s tutorial (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.trimble.com/gps/&#34;&gt;http://www.trimble.com/gps/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this exercise we are going to collect the coordinates of some set of campus features, generate a few shapefiles of those features, and then use the shapefile to make a map.  There are 3 different options for accomplishing this.  You may use the lab provided GPS units, or your cell phone.  If you are on an android device, I strongly recommend the android specific instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apps for this lab are all free with the option of upgrading to the paid version.  You do not need to pay for anything if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/Apps.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;apple-android&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple/Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are looking for the Fields Area Measure Free app.  There is a guided tutorial built right into the app, and your intuitive knowledge as digital generation should carry you the rest of the way.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/AppTutorial.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
There are a few caviats to this app.  First, you may have to sit though an ad if you drop more than a few features in a session.  Finally, the exporting of the data must be done individually (feature by feature), making the unpaid version of this unworkable for larger projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;android&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are on an android device there are a few more options available to you.  The one you will need for this lab is called Locus GIS.  The advantages of this app (Locus) over the cross platform one is several-fold.  Perhaps most critically, the app allows you to export databases of features at once without going through a paywall.  This app also seems to forgo ads when collecting data.  The forms to add data are also more robust, allowing you to add attributes and pictures to the feature.  I also feel the interface is easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;handheld-units&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handheld units&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lab also has some &lt;a href=&#34;https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/p/8480/pn/010-00322-20&#34;&gt;handheld garmin units&lt;/a&gt;.  See the website for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.garmin.com/pumac/GPSMAP60C_OwnersManual.pdf&#34;&gt;users manual&lt;/a&gt;.  For future reference I will include some quickstart instructions below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Charge the unit with the provided usb cable before going out on your adventure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-setup-and-clearing-data&#34;&gt;Initial setup and clearing data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the GPS unit is configured to collect coordinates in decimal degrees and distance is in meters:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main Menu (press Menu twice) | Setup | Units | Position format = hddd.ddddd° | Distance/Speed = Metric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the map datum will be set to WGS 84, this will correlate fine with the NAD projection of our data later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, lets clear out the old data.
* Find | Waypoints | Menu | Delete… | All Symbols | Yes
* Main Menu | Tracks | Clear | Yes | Menu | Delete All Saved | Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;collecting-data&#34;&gt;Collecting data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;collecting-a-point&#34;&gt;Collecting a point&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the Mark button. Click OK to save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To view a list of all of the waypoints you have taken, use the Find button (it leads to Waypoints menu) next to the Mark button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;collecting-a-line-or-a-polygon&#34;&gt;Collecting a line or a polygon&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to Main Menu | Tracks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To begin line: Clear | Yes (clear track   log) | Track Log on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To end line: Track Log off | Save | Yes (save all tracks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you clear the track log between tracks! (This keeps each line separate.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polygons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the same steps as lines, except you need to make sure that your line ends where it began.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some locations may initially be difficult to collect due to interference from buildings, depending on satellite geometry. If this occurs, move on and try again in a little while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;downloading-your-data-and-creating-shapefiles&#34;&gt;Downloading your data and creating shapefiles&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Start/Windows button, click the little down arrow in the bottom left corner, and then click dnrgps (under #-Programs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: you can also download from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/mis/gis/DNRGPS/DNRGPS.html&#34;&gt;Minisota Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect the GPS unit to the computer using the provided USB cable. Turn the unit on, press the Page button until you reach the Satellite screen, press the Menu button and select Use with GPS off (this helps save the battery).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the application doesn’t find your GPS unit automatically, select GPS | Find GPS (or
Connect to Default GPS).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download your point features by clicking the Waypoint menu and selecting Download.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the table of waypoints. If you see any unwanted waypoints in the table, select them and click the red X on the left side of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s project our data before we go any further. Click File | Set Projection. On the Projection tab, set the POSC Code to 26915, the datum to NAD83, and the projection to UTM zone 15N. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select all of the waypoints that you want to use and then click Edit | Project Coordinates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click File | Save To | File…. Save your waypoints as an ESRI Shapefile (2D) with the name Lab05_waypoints. Then save your waypoints as a GPS Exchange Format (*.gpx) with a sensible naming convention (like GEOG358_Lab3Waypoints).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloading tracks is similar to downloading waypoints, but it can be a bit trickier. Click Track | Download. Select all the records (rows) that correspond to your track—this is where things can get confusing—and then click File | Save To | File…. Save your track as an ESRI Shapefile (2D) with a sensible name. If it asks for a Shape Type, select Line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re done creating your shapefiles, close the DNR GPS application, turn the GPS unit off, and disconnect the unit from your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-with-your-shapefiles-in-arcmap&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working with your shapefiles in ArcMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcMap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the shapefiles you created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the little down arrow next to the Add Data button and select Add Basemap. Choose a basemap that you think would look good with your shapefiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend some time playing around with different basemaps and different ways to symbolize your new features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a map and upload a PNG of it to Blackboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;open-your-features-in-google-earth&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open your features in Google Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s look at our point shapefile in Google Earth, which uses a KML file format.  As you may have seen in the apps, this is an export filetype but is behind a paywall.  Fortunately ArcGIS can do the conversion for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the ArcToolbox and select Conversion Tools &amp;gt; To KML &amp;gt; Layer To KML.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the appropriate layers in the Layer dropdown menu. Click the folder button next to Output File, navigate to your personal lab folder, and save the file as MyFeatureName.kml. Change the Layer Output Scale to 1. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Windows Explorer, double-click the file you just created. (If you don’t see it, look for KMZ File under the Type column.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Earth should open and zoom to the location where your points are. Are your points where they’re supposed to be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a cool view angle and zoom level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Earth lets you export these as a neat map with the appropriate map elements.  Fill in the pertinent data, save it, and upload it to Blackboard.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/GoogleEarthExport.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;common-errors&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common errors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;When I open my KML layer adobe pops up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows has set the default program to handle KML layers as adobe for some reason.  You can either right click on the file and open with &amp;gt; find program, or open Google Earth and go to File &amp;gt; Open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-image-georeferencing&#34;&gt;Part 1: Image Georeferencing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction
Image data are a common source of information and are particularly useful when mapping vegetation, wetlands, or other natural resources. Scanned photos have some geometric distortion, but this distortion may not be too great, depending on our error specifications and how the photo was taken (flying height, focal length of camera, etc.).
Digital orthophotoquads (DOQs) are scanned photos for which most of these errors have been removed. DOQs are being developed for the entire U.S. by the US Geological Survey (USGS). DOQs are a common data source for resource management agencies.
The problem is that scanned images will be in some arbitrary scanner or screen coordinate system. If we wish to convert the digitized vector features to a projected coordinate system, we must perform an image registration. An image registration converts the image from a file or scanner coordinate system to a projected map coordinate system.
There are many forms of image registration, but the simplest is called a first-order or affine transformation. An affine transformation is appropriate when the terrain is flat and the photograph has been taken with a vertically oriented (mapping) camera; otherwise, a projective transformation should be used.
In this lab exercise you will be taking a scanned DOQ over north Lawrence from 1976 and register it to an image from 2004 that already contains geographic coordinates and a projection. You will then digitize roads in a study area that represent the conditions in 1976 that you can then compare to the current road conditions in the more recent image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-georeference-a-scanned-aerial-photo&#34;&gt;1. Georeference a scanned aerial photo&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new map document in ArcMap. Save it in your OneDrive as
GEOG358_Lab04_Part1.mxd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the naip2004sub.img from the data folder to the data frame. This image has a projected coordinate system (UTM Zone 15 NAD83). We will register the scanned image to this coordinate system, thus making it the “control layer.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add lawrencenorth.tif image to the data frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you see the warning about pyramids, recall what this is asking you about and if you see an &amp;ldquo;unreferenced&amp;rdquo; warning, Click OK, that&amp;rsquo;s what we are here to fix&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the image that we will register to a projected coordinate system, thus making it the “target layer.” Since the image doesn’t have a projection yet, it will not be immediately visible; right-click the layer and select Zoom to Layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine each image in order to discover what features they have in common (e.g., bridges).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Customize menu, select Toolbars, and then Georeferencing. The Georeferencing toolbar will appear in ArcMap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure Layer is set to lawrencenorth.tif in the Georeferencing toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, make sure that lawrencenorth.tif is on top of naip2004sub.img in the table of contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we must select a succession of control links between the target layer and the control layer. These will be based on features that the images have in common. Find a road intersection in the lawrencenorth.tif layer. Zoom in close enough so that you can clearly see the width of the road. Click the Add Control Points button on the Georeferencing toolbar and then click once right in the center of the intersection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the naip2004sub.img layer and select Zoom to Layer. Find the intersection that you clicked in the other layer. Zoom in and click in the center of the intersection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat this procedure 11 more times in different parts of the image for a total of 12 control points. The more evenly you spread out your control points, the better. Note that after the second control point the images will overlap, so you will need to turn layers on and off in order to establish the remaining control points. (Fun!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you make a mistake, you can delete it by clicking the View Link Table button, select the row of the point, and hit Delete on your keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With each successive control link, the image should line up a bit better. If all goes well, you should see the image shift slightly to match the control image. Don’t be alarmed if the images become temporarily distorted during this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the View Link Table button. In the upper right hand corner, next to the word “Forward” is your RMS (root mean square), which is a measure of the accuracy of your registration. If your RMS is higher than 15, bad news: You need to redo your control points, this time with more precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your RMS is under 15, enlarge your Link Table so that all 12 points are listed and then take a screen shot. Save the image as GEOG358_Lab04_Part1.png.  This should look like so.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/Georeference.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is one last step in the georeferencing process, to save the reference for future use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before procedding, open up the file explorer to the data folder and make note of the files in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the georeferenceing bar click Update georefernce&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were sucessful you should now see a new .twf file, and your image is now referenced.  Huzzah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2-on-screen-digitizing&#34;&gt;Part 2: On-Screen Digitizing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introduction
In this part of the lab you will learn how to digitize features from a scanned USGS topographic map.  Digitizing is the process of converting paper map or image data to vector digital data. In manual vector digitizing, you trace the lines or points from the source media. You control a cursor, usually with a mouse or digitizing puck, and select vertices to define the point, line, or polygonal features you wish to capture. The source media may be hardcopy (e.g., maps on a digitizing table), or softcopy (e.g., a digital image or scanned map). ArcGIS allows us to digitize using either hardcopy or softcopy sources.  This lab will involve digitizing a set of features from a scanned USGS 1:24,000 topographic map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcMap. Close any alerts that pop up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the map document in an appropriate place as GEOG358_Lab04_Part2.mxd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Add Data button, navigate to the lab data and add usgsLawEast.tif and StudyArea.shp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s change the symbology of the StudyArea layer so that the polygons are hollow. The easiest way to do this is to click the colored box under the layer name and then select “Hollow” from the list of symbols. While you’re there, change the Outline Width to 5 so we can see it better. Change the color of the outline if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the StudyArea layer and select Zoom To Layer. Recognize this area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Pan button (looks like a hand) and then drag the map around until you find the KU campus. (Hint: It’s to the southwest of the study area!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-shapefiles-for-digitizing&#34;&gt;Create shapefiles for digitizing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ArcCatalog window, connect to the lab data folder, Right-click in the folder, and select New | Shapefile….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the shapefile Buildings and make sure the Feature Type is set to Point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Edit button to add a coordinate system.  Select Projected Coordinate Systems &amp;gt; UTM &amp;gt; NAD 1983 &amp;gt; NAD 1983 UTM Zone 15N.prj&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK. Click OK again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the last few steps to create two more shapefiles: A polyline shapefile called Streets and a polygon shapefile called Parks. Make sure you set their projections to the same one as the Buildings shapefile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digitize-point-features&#34;&gt;Digitize point features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Customize menu, go to Toolbars, and select Editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Editor toolbar, start an edit session by clicking the Editor button and selecting Start Editing. (If a dialog box comes up, click OK.) A Create Features window will appear. Notice that the Construction Tools section near the bottom is empty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Create Features window, click Buildings (not the heading, but the one with the point symbol to its left). Since Buildings is a point shapefile, there are now point-related tools in the Construction Tools section. Make sure that you have the Point tool selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the StudyArea layer and select Zoom To Layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the map, you will see little solid black shapes scattered about. These are buildings, and we are going to digitize them as points. Move your mouse to the center of each building in the study area—zoom in further if you need to—and simply click. These points will be added into the Buildings layer. If you make a mistake, click the Edit Tool (it looks like an arrowhead pointing northwest) on the Editor toolbar, click the point, and then drag it to the correct location or hit Delete.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you finish digitizing all the buildings, click the Editor button, and select Save Edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the symbology of your new Buildings layer if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digitize-line-features-point-mode&#34;&gt;Digitize line features – Point Mode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Create Features window, click Streets. Make sure you have the Line tool selected below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Editor button, select Snapping, and then Snapping Toolbar. Hover your mouse over a random section of the study area boundary. Notice how the cursor “snaps” to the line and says Study Area: Edge. This snapping function will help you connect your street lines properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a street intersection on the northern edge of the study area. Click on the intersection— close enough to the study area so that the cursor snaps to it—to begin a line. Add more vertices to the line by clicking your mouse along the streets; as you might imagine, curved streets require more vertices. When you want to finish a line, just double-click where you want it to end. Use this method for roughly half of the streets in the study area. (We will finish the rest using a different method.) Don’t get too hung up on making perfect streets. Save your edits periodically by clicking the Editor button and selecting Save Edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re finish digitizing, save your edits again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the symbology of your new line layer to something more visible (e.g., make the lines wider, change the color, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digitize-line-features-stream-mode&#34;&gt;Digitize line features – Stream Mode&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last section we digitized streets using Point Mode, which requires you to select vertices to make lines. This is a precise way to digitize, but in some cases you might want a quicker method that doesn’t involve as much precision. Enter Stream Mode. In Stream Mode, you make one vertex and then simply trace over your feature (sans clicking) until you’re done. After you finish the feature, ArcMap automatically adds vertices at an interval of your choosing. This interval is called the stream tolerance, and you can change it at any time, including when you’re in the middle of digitizing a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Editor toolbar, click the Editor button and select Options….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the General tab. In the Stream Mode section, change the Stream tolerance to 0.1 map units. Just below that, change the number of points [grouped] together when streaming to 10. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you have the Line tool selected. Right-click anywhere on the map and select
Streaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re ready to digitize, just click, trace your feature, and double-click. Digitize the rest of the study area streets using this method. Save your edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End the edit session by clicking Editor and selecting Stop Editing. Save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;editing-the-streets-attribute-table&#34;&gt;Editing the Streets attribute table&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Table of Contents, right-click your Streets layer and select Open Attribute Table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Table Options button (upper left corner) and select Add Field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Name field type Name. (That’s not a typo!) Change the Type to Text. Under Field Properties change the Length to 25. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create another field called Suffix. Change its Type to Text and change its Length to 4. Close the attribute table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the Streets layer, select Selection and then Make This The Only Selectable Layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an edit session. Click the Select Features tool (five places to the right of the Full Extent button). Looking at the map, click the street feature that corresponds to Lincoln Street in the map. The street will turn blue-green if selected properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Streets attribute table again. The record for the street feature you selected will be highlighted. Click in that record’s Name field and enter Lincoln. Click in the Suffix field and enter St.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the last couple steps to find and name 5th St.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Clear Selected Features button (to the right of the Select Features button).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Streets attribute table, click the leftmost part of the Lincoln St. record. This will select the record in the table and the map. Resize and/or move your attribute table so you can see that the Lincoln St. line was selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the attribute table and save your edits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, ArcMap will only display one field at a time, and so once we tell it to display the Streets labels, it will just say “Lincoln” and “5th” (i.e., without “St.”). Let’s fix that. In the Table of Contents, double-click the Streets layer and click the Labels tab. Change the Label Field to Name. Click the Expression button. In the Expression box add the character &amp;amp; after [Name], and then double-click Suffix in the Fields box above. The expression in the box should read [Name] &amp;amp; [Suffix]. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Text Symbol section make the font bold, size 12, and a color that you think will stand out on the map. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Table of Contents, right-click the Streets layer and select Label Features. Do you see labels on the streets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You may notice the lack of space between the name and the suffix of streets. If you wish, you can fix this problem by going back the Expression box and changing the text to [Name] &amp;amp; “ ” [Suffix].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;digitize-polygon-features&#34;&gt;Digitize polygon features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Create Features window, click Parks. Make sure you have the Polygon tool selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at the map, you should see two trailer parks. For each one, digitize a single polygon over the whole white-ish area. (The process is similar to creating line features in Point Mode.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your edits and end the edit session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Parks attribute table. Using the same steps as the Streets layer, add new field called Name, change its Type to Text, and change the Length to 25.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an edit session. In the attribute table, enter names for the trailer parks (e.g., Northwest Trailer Park, Southeast Trailer Park).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your edits, end the edit session, and save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;make-a-map&#34;&gt;Make a map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a quick map of the study area:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include the three layers you created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t include the map image (usgsLawEast.tif).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Label the Streets and Parks features. If you want to change the look of the labels, play around in the Labels tab in the layer’s Properties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the fill color of the StudyArea from Hollow to 10% gray, and make its outline thinner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include a title, author, north arrow, scale, legend, and neatline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export a PNG of the map. Call it GEOG358_Lab04_Part2.png.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have two images, which you will submit on blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-4-zonal-operations-tornado-siren-coverage-analysis-and-lake-volume-calculations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 4: Zonal Operations – Tornado Siren Coverage Analysis and Lake Volume Calculations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of this lab requires writing a survey of the data and mapping technologies in the field that you are interested in (wildlife reserve, conservation, urban planning, forest resources, natural hazards, business, etc.), not limited to the data and mapping technologies covered in the lecture. This survey may include both traditional and new emerging datasets and/or mapping technologies that are used in the fields. The second part of the lab will download imagery and create a database that will be used for the next few labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-you-need-to-submit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to submit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lab 4: Answer Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Total Douglas County population:&lt;br /&gt;
Number of people who can hear the tornado sirens:&lt;br /&gt;
Number of people who cannot hear the tornado sirens:&lt;br /&gt;
Percentage of the population that can hear the tornado sirens:&lt;br /&gt;
Percentage of total population that cannot hear the tornado sirens:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Your math should add up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How much water did the lake gain over the time period:&lt;br /&gt;
Which period did the volume grow the fastest, 1995-2003 or 2003-2009?&lt;br /&gt;
Write a short (2-4 healthy paragraphs) analysis regarding this process.  Some topics to touch on include how this analysis was performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would you expect a significantly different answer if you tweaked the methods?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the sources of error in this process?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we address those, and the uncertainty they add to our analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-tornado-siren-coverage&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Tornado siren coverage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-buffers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Buffers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcMap, create a new empty map, and save your map document to your personal folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;i&gt;countybnd.shp&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;roads.shp&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;censusblk.shp&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;sirens.shp&lt;/i&gt; from your Part1 folder to the empty arcmap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buffers around the sirens using the &lt;strong&gt;buffer&lt;/strong&gt; tool and the following settings:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input Features: &lt;em&gt;sirens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Features: &lt;i&gt;sirens_buffer.shp&lt;/i&gt; (make sure to save in your Part1 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Unit: 5800 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissolve Type: None&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrange layers so that you can see the siren points and buffers on top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s remove the common polygon lines in the buffers. In ArcToolbox go to Data Management Tools | Generalization | &lt;strong&gt;Dissolve&lt;/strong&gt;. Use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input Features: &lt;i&gt;sirens_buffer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Features: &lt;i&gt;sirens_buffer_dissolve.shp&lt;/i&gt; (make sure to save in your Part1 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the symbology of the layers to the colors and symbols of your choice, and arrange the layers accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that you could have just used the dissolve type parameter in the buffer tool, but now you know where both are :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-percentage-of-population-covered-by-sirens&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding the Percentage of Population Covered by Sirens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;i&gt;kansas2000censusblk.dbf&lt;/i&gt; to the data frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;i&gt;censusblk&lt;/i&gt; layer, select Joins and Relates, and select Join. Join the layer to &lt;i&gt;kansas2000censusblk.dbf&lt;/i&gt; using the STFID field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine the attribute table of &lt;i&gt;censusblk&lt;/i&gt; to make sure the join was successful. Do you see all sorts of demographic attributes? If so, the join was successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the header of the &lt;i&gt;POP2000&lt;/i&gt; attribute and select Statistics. The sum value is the number of people in Douglas County. Record the value somewhere, as you will be entering this into the comments section of your Blackboard submission. Close the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Select by Location… to select the census blocks that are within the buffer zone.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Use the are completely within the source layer feature setting. The result should be 1,590 census blocks selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the population in these census blocks by opening the &lt;i&gt;censusblk&lt;/i&gt; attribute table, right- clicking the &lt;i&gt;POP2000&lt;/i&gt; attribute header, and selecting Statistics. (It will only give you statistics on the selected records.) Record this number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the population out of the range of sirens by clicking Table Options (upper left corner of the attribute table), selecting Switch Selection, and then using the &lt;strong&gt;Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; tool again. Record this number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch the selection back (i.e., back to the blocks within range of the sirens) and close the attribute table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer the part 1 questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-2-lake-volume-estimations&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Lake Volume estimations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your Lab 2 Part 1 mxd or create a data frame/document.  This document should have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AOI shapefile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lake boundary classifications &lt;i&gt;(…NDWI_#.TIF)&lt;/i&gt; )for 1995, 2003, and 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The RGB file for each year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The elevation data&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;isolate-the-lake-boundary&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolate the lake boundary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you have already noticed, we need to isolate the lake boundary from any errant, misclassified pixels.  We can do that a few different ways you can do this.  For each image, redefine an AOI and use the raster clip to isolate the lake boundary.  This is time consuming unsalable, and poorly reproducible.  Here we will deploy a focal approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more preferable way to do this is to use region groups, a tool you will cover in much more depth later in the semester.  For now, just know that it groups clusters of raster pixels into unique groups.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;i&gt;…LakeBoundary.tif&lt;/i&gt; as the input raster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output raster as &lt;i&gt;…groups.tif&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Eight connectivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the identify tool to pick out the value of the lake edge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the raster calculator to create a zone of just that value.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: mine looks like &lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;LT05_L1TP_008067_19950622_20170109_01_T1_LakeBoundry_Group.TIF&amp;rdquo; == 10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overwrite your lake boundary raster&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculate-the-height-the-water-rises-to-on-the-terrain&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate the height the water rises to on the terrain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will use zonal statistics and our newly created zone to calculate the (insert statistic here) value of the elevation data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the newly created lake boundary as our zonal definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want the statistics from the elevation data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a statistic, I chose maximum but feel free to explore other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as &lt;i&gt;…LakeBoundary_ZonalStat.tif&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This output is the “elevation” of the water, we then need to place this value in a raster that we can subtract from the DEM to calculate a lake depth at each pixel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-the-lake-surface-elevation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the lake surface elevation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to use the same process as above to pick out just the lake (i.e. &lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;(&amp;ldquo;…LakeBoundry_Group.TIF&amp;rdquo; == 10) | (&amp;ldquo;…LakeBoundry_Group.TIF&amp;rdquo; == 12)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as &lt;i&gt;…LakeRaster.tif&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then need to use the reclassify tool to turn the binary lake classification into a lake elevation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn 0’s into NoData.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn 1’s into the value of the zonal statistic output calculated in the previous step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as &lt;i&gt;…LakeSurface.tif&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;calculate-the-lake-depth-and-the-lake-volume&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate the lake depth and the lake volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now need to subtract our two surfaces&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: RasterCalcuator(lakeSurface – Elevation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as &lt;i&gt;…LakeDepth.tif&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Examine the attribute table of the subtraction grid (R-click on &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth&lt;/i&gt; | Open Attribute Table).
&lt;li&gt;Click the Select by Attribute button and select cells with an elevation difference greater than 0.
&lt;li&gt;Export selected cells (Table Options | Export…) as a dBASE Table file named &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth1995.dbf&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;li&gt;When asked if you want to add the table to your map, select Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you cannot see &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth1995.dbf&lt;/i&gt; in your Table of Contents, you will need to switch to List By Source view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth1995.dbf&lt;/i&gt; (R-click | Open)
&lt;li&gt;Add a new field (Table Options | Add Field) and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the name to &lt;i&gt;Area&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type to float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precision to 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scale to 1 and then click OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the surface area of &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth1995&lt;/i&gt; using the following equation, &lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;area = # of cells (count) * length of cell * width of cell&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hint #1: (R-click column to be calculated, choose Field Calculator… if asked about calculating outside an Editing session, click Yes)
&lt;br&gt;
Hint #2: the length and width of the cell comes from the cell size of the grid, since the cells are square, the values are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add a new field and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the name to &lt;i&gt;cell_vol&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type to float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precision to 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scale to 1 and then click OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calculate the volume per cell of &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth1995&lt;/i&gt; using the following equation: &lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;cell_vol = depth (i.e., Value) * length of cell * width of cell&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/mark&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a new field and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set the name to &lt;i&gt;total_vol&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type to float&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precision to 16&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scale to 1 and then click OK
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the total volume of &lt;i&gt;LakeDepth1995&lt;/i&gt; using the following equation: &lt;mark&gt;&lt;i&gt;total_vol = volume per cell (cell_vol) * total number of cells (count)&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to perform this process twice more for 2003 and 2009, answer the part 2 questions, and submit both parts to Blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lab 05 - Building a GIS database</title>
      <link>https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/lab05/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lab will teach you how to build a GIS database for Douglas County, KS using existing digital data from the Internet. First you will download data from Kansas Geospatial Community Commons (provided by Data Access and Support Center, or DASC). Then you will define coordinate systems and project the data to Kansas State Plane Coordinate System NAD83 meters North Zone. You will then make a second map of a county of your choice using the USGS National Map Website as your data source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of this lab is to learn how to retrieve GIS data. Gathering data is often one of the more difficult challenges for beginning GIS users, but there is a wealth of data available on the Internet for free, it just takes a little Google-foo &amp;amp; massaging to get what you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;tutorial&#34;&gt;Tutorial&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-creating-a-gis-database&#34;&gt;Part 1: Creating a GIS Database&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-getting-started-create-the-lab05-folder-structure&#34;&gt;1. Getting started: Create the Lab05 folder structure&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Lab05 folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within that folder, create Part1 and Part2 folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the Part1 folder, create three new folders called…&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataIn (this will be the folder you download data into)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataClip (this folder will be for data that has been clipped to the Douglas County boundaries),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DataProj (this will be the folder in which you will save data that you have projected and renamed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the Part2 folder, create the same folder structure.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/LabInitalLayout.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-download-data-from-the-kansas-geospatial-community-commons&#34;&gt;2. Download data from the Kansas Geospatial Community Commons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in lab 1, a geoportal is a great place to find GIS data.  For data related to Kansas, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kansasgis.org&#34;&gt;Kansas Data Access Support Center (DASC)&lt;/a&gt; is the place to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kansasgis.org&#34;&gt;DASC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to download data, you need to create a username and password. To do this, click on “Register” in the upper right corner of the webpage. Feel free to give the KU Department of Geography’s address and phone number as your information:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1475 Jayhawk Blvd, 213 Lindley Hall, University of Kansas Lawrence, KS 66045-7613&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(785) 864-5143&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your account has been confirmed, click on “Catalog.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are interested in the following data:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Census blocks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;County boundaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrography features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s start with the census blocks.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;em&gt;Administrative Boundaries&lt;/em&gt; category and then click Blocks from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the File Downloads tab in the top panel of the web page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the TIGER2012_Blocks.zip (2012- Includes 2010 demographic data) link and select Save Link As… When prompted for a location, browse to your Part1 DataIn folder and save it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the same procedure to download Counties (TIGER2010_Census_County.zip (2010- Includes demographic data) located under Administrative Boundaries).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we want to download hydrographic (streams and lakes) data.  Under the &lt;em&gt;Water Resources&lt;/em&gt; category in the &lt;em&gt;Kansas Water Features&lt;/em&gt; data you will find

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHD Flow Lines (NHD_FLOWLINES_SHP.zip)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHD Water Areas (NHD_AREA_SHP.zip)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NHD Water Bodies (NHD_WATERBODIES_SHP.zip)
which are part of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Download them all to your Part1 DataIn folder. (Note: Make sure you’re downloading shapefiles—the first option listed—rather than file geodatabases.) These are big files, so be patient while they’re downloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lastly, download the TIGER Roadways – 2012 shapefile (TIGER2012_Roads_Info.zip under the &lt;em&gt;Transportation&lt;/em&gt; category).  Your final folder layout should look like so:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/DataInLayout.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-unzipping-data&#34;&gt;3. Unzipping data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using Windows Explorer, extract all the zipped files you downloaded. (One way to do this is to right-click each folder and select Extract All. Another way is to select all the folders, right-click and select 7-Zip, and then select Extract Here.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a new map in ArcMap and add all the data you just examined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your ArcMap document as GEOG358Lab05_Part1_YourLastName.mxd in your Lab05 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-clipping-data&#34;&gt;4. Clipping data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clip data, we theoretically need two pieces of information, the extent we want to clip to and the features we want to clip.  ArcMap follows this convention, although there are a number of caveats to how it is implemented, and there are several ways to accomplish a clip.  Here we will select a single feature from a layer, and the extent of that selection will dictate the extent of the clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;selecting-an-area-to-clip-to&#34;&gt;Selecting an area to clip to:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The layers in your map cover the entire state of Kansas. Since we are making a map of only Douglas County, we will clip off the rest of the data we don’t need. First, we need to select the boundaries to use in our clip analysis. Open the attribute table of Tiger2010_Census_County (Right-click | Open Attribute Table), click the Table Options button (upper left corner) and select Select By Attributes&amp;hellip;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the box near the bottom of the window, use the mouse to enter the expression:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-SQL&#34;&gt;“NAME10” = ‘Douglas’
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “code” is a variation of SQL (Structured Query Language, remember this from Lab 2?)  It really cares about syntax, so it’s usually best to have ArcMap build the code for you (by using the mouse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When that is done click the Verify button. If there are no problems, click Apply; if there are problems, double- check to make sure you typed the expression correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas County should now be selected in your attribute table and map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close the attribute table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;clipping-features&#34;&gt;Clipping features:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcToolbox. Under Analysis Tools | Extract, double-click the Clip tool.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the dropdown menu (click the down arrow) for Input Features, select the Tiger2010_Roadways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the dropdown menu for Clip Features, select Tiger2010_Census_County.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the Output Feature Class, browse to your Part1 DataClip folder and save the file as Tiger2010_Roadways_Clip.shp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press OK to execute the tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the Clip tool has finished, turn off all layers in the table of contents except for Tiger2010_Census_County and Tiger2010_Roadways_Clip. If the roads are only shown in Douglas County, your clip was successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the Clip tool again for the other layers: NHDArea, NHDWaterbody, NHD FlowLines and Tiger2012 _Blocks. (Use those layers as the Input Features; Tiger2010_Census_County will be your Clip Feature in every instance. Make sure all output goes into your Part1 DataClip folder.) These steps will take time, so please be patient!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, right-click the Tiger2010_Census_County layer, select Data, and select Export Data…. Make sure the Export drop-down menu is set to “Selected features”. Change the output destination to your DataClip folder, change the Save as type to Shapefile, and save the file as DouglasCounty.shp. (This will create a layer of just Douglas County.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once all clipping is completed, remove the original (i.e., unclipped) layers from your table of contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-re-project-the-shapefiles-to-kansas-state-plane&#34;&gt;5. Re-project the shapefiles to Kansas State Plane&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your ArcMap document, you should now have all the newly clipped shapefiles in your Data Frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcToolbox, go to Data Management Tools | Projections and Transformations, and double-click the Project tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Re-project each of the clipped shapefiles to NAD 1983 StatePlane Kansas North FIPS 1501 (Meters).

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projected Coordinate Systems -&amp;gt; State Plane -&amp;gt; NAD 1983 (Meters) -&amp;gt; NAD1983 StatePlane Kansas North FIPS 1501 (Meters).prj)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: You can search WKID: 6466&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you save the new files to your Lab05 DataProj folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remove all un-projected data from your map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the data frame (Layers) and select Properties…. Click the Coordinate System tab and change the coordinate system to NAD1983 State Plane Kansas North FIPS 1501 (meters).prj (the same as above).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom in to Douglas County, take a screenshot of your entire screen, and upload the screenshot to Blackboard.  It should look something like:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/DouglasCountyProjected.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2-creating-your-own-county-map&#34;&gt;Part 2: Creating your own county map&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following section involves obtaining spatial data from the United States Geological Survey National Map website.  We will create another map of a different county. For this part, we will use the new National Map website to make a map of a county outside of Kansas. If you are not from here, you can select your home county, or pick one you like. If you lack imagination, use one of the following:
* Aroostook County, in Northernmost Maine
* Miami-Dade Counties in Southernmost Florida
Do not select Douglas County.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-download-data-from-usgs-national-map&#34;&gt;1. Download data from USGS National Map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/?howTo=true&#34;&gt;The National Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom into your area of interest until you can read city and county names on the map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the Current Extent button is selected at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle on Boundaries and Transportation. Make note of the other types of layers that are available on this site. It is a great resource for your final project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the catagories you toggled on, make sure you are getting either shapefiles or GeoTIFF, using the correct extent, and then click Find Products&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you did this right, your window should look like so:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/TNMView.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the results tab that appears under each layer, you can…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the footprint of each layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the metadata for the later&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and download the data into your Part 2 DataIn folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This process will create separate files for each of the three datasets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, unzip the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-download-data-from-the-multi-resolution-land-characteristics-mrlc-consortium&#34;&gt;2. Download data from the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several land cover datasets, but perhaps the most pertinent to the US is the National Land Cover Dataset(NLCD), produced by the MRLC Consortium .  Some time last year they updated their data policies and, in what I can only surmise was an effort to streamline data distribution system, made it almost impossible to get their data in a usable form without diving into tools unsuited to an intro level class.  There are two ways in which you can proceed.  If you trust your PC, you can download the whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mrlc/NLCD_2016_Land_Cover_L48_20190424.zip&#34;&gt;1.4 GB NLCD database&lt;/a&gt; and then clip to your county.  Alternatively, you can download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/land-cover-data-download?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects&#34;&gt;GAP/LANDFIRE land cover dataset&lt;/a&gt; by state and clip from there.  Regardless of your final choice, after this step you should have an unzipped geotiff in your folder.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/LandCoverData.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-add-the-data-to-a-new-data-frame&#34;&gt;3. Add the data to a new data frame&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert &amp;gt; New data frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename the new data frame to part 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the data to this data frame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you should have the one raster (Land Cover) and two shapefiles (Boundaries and transportation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-re-project-the-layers-to-the-appropriate-utm-zone-projection&#34;&gt;4. Re-project the Layers to the appropriate UTM zone projection.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To decide which UTM zone is appropriate, remember you have the world at your fingertips (Google it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the projection of your raster by inspecting the source tab in its properties window. If it is not in the UTM zone you intend to use, reproject it.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcToolbox and use the Data Management | Projection and Transformations| Raster | Project Raster tool to re-project the rasters to Projected Coordinate systems &amp;gt; UTM &amp;gt; NAD1983 &amp;gt; UTM Zone ??? N.prj&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project your shapefiles into the same UTM zone. Data Management | Projection and Transformations| Project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-clip-the-layers-to-the-area-of-interest&#34;&gt;5. Clip the layers to the area of interest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, let’s explore the search function.  If we were to phrase what we want to accomplish using GIS terminology, we want to clip a raster to a shapefile.  We don’t really know if this is possible, but if we search for “clip” we get several variants including…
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/ClipSearchResults.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, the third clip tool (in the Data Management) toolbox seems promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and click on the correct tool and set up the tool like so.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Notes:
&amp;gt; Again, include .tif in the filename
&amp;gt; If your area is irregular and you want to make a tight clip (as opposed to an outer bounding box clip), check the “Use input clipping geometry (optional)” box
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/ClipToolSetup.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-make-a-map&#34;&gt;6 Make a map&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Produce a map (keeping in mind our cartographic rules) of the reprojected county data containing the following layers: roads on top of the LAND COVER raster. If you would like, the map can show only a zoomed in portion of your county, rather than the whole thing. For this map, you need to include your name, title, legend, scale bar and north arrow. Be sure to save your map. Now export it as an image named yournameLab5Part2.png. Save the .png in your Lab05 folder and upload it to blackboard.  Spend, at the very minimum, ten minutes on this, a bad looking map is worse at communicating an idea than no map at all.  As a reference, here is what 10 minutes of my time looks like.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/MyMap.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have two images, which you will submit on blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is more often the case than not, the information we need to answer a question are in separate places (read: shapefiles).  Therefore, we need to join that data together.  However, the concept of joins are communicated, implemented, and executed very differently within a computer/GIS context than they are in everyday language.  Database joins are their own class in computer science/engineering, and we won’t cover all of them in this class.  For this lab we will use two, a left join and geographic joins.  You can think about left joins as joining two excel sheets together based on a common (or key) field.  Spatial joins append entries that match the geographic filter (interest, buffer, ect.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-attribute-spatial-queries&#34;&gt;Part 1: Attribute &amp;amp; Spatial Queries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part we will execute queries by attribute, queries by space, and spatial joins. We will also conduct a simple analysis using these functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/j610c377_home_ku_edu/Ec0rmWqkQeFBo5v4RyuGZZwB6CC-W_4F_77X0OKvzqTicA?e=S2lCWn&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Lab handout&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-download-the-lab-data&#34;&gt;1. Download the lab data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcMap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;em&gt;bookstores.shp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;counties.shp&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;istates.shp&lt;/em&gt; from the Part01 folder to your data frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the data frame (&lt;em&gt;Layers&lt;/em&gt;) properties and click on the &lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; tab. Make sure the Map Units are set to &lt;strong&gt;Meters&lt;/strong&gt; and the Display Units are set to &lt;strong&gt;Miles&lt;/strong&gt;. Click &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-attribute-queries-select-by-attribute&#34;&gt;2. Attribute Queries (Select by Attribute)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Selection | Select By Attribute&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the Layer to counties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the Method option is set to &lt;strong&gt;Create a new selection&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attributes for the counties layer (&lt;em&gt;“FID”, “AREA”, …&lt;/em&gt;) are displayed in the upper half of the window. You can double click on the attributes of interest to make it part of the expression in the lower half of the window. In the middle are the various operators that you will use. On the right, you can click the &lt;strong&gt;Get Unique Values&lt;/strong&gt; button, which will display all of the unique values for the attribute you selected.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example of an expression is (“countyname” = ‘Douglas’), where Douglas county would be selected if we had a Kansas county dataset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s &lt;strong&gt;select the counties where populations in 1990 were greater than 30,000 people&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the box with the attributes, scroll down and double-click “POP1990”. Notice that it shows up in the lower box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now click the &amp;gt; button. In the lower box, type 30000 (no commas!) so that your expression reads: &amp;ldquo;POP1990&amp;rdquo; &amp;gt; 30000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that you can always just type the entire expression yourself instead of double-clicking attribute names, etc.; the advantage of double- clicking attribute names, however, is that it reduces the probability of typos in your expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check your expression by clicking the Verify button. If everything is correct, the program will tell you that “The expression was successfully verified.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Apply once the expression is verified and then look at the map. You should see most of the counties selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-selection-statistics&#34;&gt;2. Selection Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Selection | Statistics&lt;/strong&gt;. This function calculates statistics based on the attributes of the selected features. If you have five counties selected, for example, you can find out the average area of those counties by selecting Area in the Field menu and then looking at the statistics below it. Changing the attributes in the Field menu won’t change which features you have selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;strong&gt;Select By Attributes and Statistics tools, answer &lt;em&gt;Questions #1 through #5 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Note that the Select By Attributes and Statistics windows can be open at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear the selected counties by going to &lt;strong&gt;Selection | Clear Select Features&lt;/strong&gt; or by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Clear Selected Features&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the Select By Attributes and Statistics windows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-spatial-queries&#34;&gt;3. Spatial Queries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the counties layer properties. Click the Selection tab, click with this color, and select a bright red color. Click Apply and OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the same procedure to make the bookstores layer selections green and the istates layer selections yellow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Select By Attributes function&lt;/strong&gt; to select &lt;em&gt;Richland County&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Think about which attribute would contain the names of counties, select it, and then use the Get Unique Values button to get the list of county names.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now go to &lt;strong&gt;Selection | Select by Location…&lt;/strong&gt; with the following parameters:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selection method&lt;/em&gt;: select features from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target layer(s)&lt;/em&gt;: bookstores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source layer&lt;/em&gt;: counties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use selected features&lt;/em&gt;: (yes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spatial selection method…&lt;/em&gt;: are completely within the source layer feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the bookstores in Richland County should now be green, indicating that they were properly selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Selection | Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; to find how many bookstores are in Richland County.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Make sure the bookstores layer is selected!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer Question #6 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear the selected features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Select By Attributes&lt;/strong&gt; tool to select Interstate 26 in the &lt;em&gt;istates&lt;/em&gt; layer.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Don’t use the ISTATES_ or ISTATES_ID attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I-26 will be highlighted as yellow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Select by Location&lt;/strong&gt; tool with the following parameters:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selection method&lt;/em&gt;: select features from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target layer(s)&lt;/em&gt;: counties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source layer&lt;/em&gt;: istates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use selected features&lt;/em&gt;: (yes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spatial selection method…&lt;/em&gt;: intersect (3d) the source layer feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The counties that I-26 passes through will turn red.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the Statistics tool to find the &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; median home income for those counties. (Yes, the mean of the median.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer Question #7 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear the selected features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s find bookstores that are within 15 miles of I-26. As before, select I-26 from the &lt;em&gt;istates&lt;/em&gt; layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Select By Location&lt;/strong&gt; tool with the following parameters:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selection method&lt;/em&gt;: select features from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Target layer(s)&lt;/em&gt;: bookstores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source layer&lt;/em&gt;: istates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use selected features&lt;/em&gt;: (yes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spatial selection method&lt;/em&gt;: are within a distance of the source layer feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply a search distance (this will be grayed out): 15 miles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer Question #8 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear selected features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer Question #9 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your map document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-two-attribute-joins-and-spatial-joins&#34;&gt;Part Two: Attribute Joins and Spatial Joins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part we will execute a spatial join and then conduct a simple analysis.
The Loma Prieta earthquake (Richter 7.1) occurred on October 17, 1989 at 5:04pm Pacific Time. The epicenter was 37° 02&amp;rsquo; 00&amp;rdquo; N and 121° 53&amp;rsquo; 23&amp;rdquo; W. A large number of residential homes were damaged by the earthquake, and many were destroyed. You will be investigating the distribution of damaged homes in relation to active surface faults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-join-the-insurance-database-to-the-spatial-data&#34;&gt;1. Join the insurance database to the spatial data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a new ArcMap document or add a new data frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;em&gt;shomes.shp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sszpoly.shp&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;insustatus.dbf&lt;/em&gt; from the Part02 folder to the workspace. If you get a warning about an Unknown Spatial Reference, just click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the data frame map units to Meters and display units to Miles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;attribute table&lt;/strong&gt; of the shomes layer. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer Question #10 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right-click&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;shomes&lt;/em&gt; layer and select &lt;strong&gt;Joins and Relates | Join…&lt;/strong&gt;. Use the following parameters:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you want to join to this layer?&lt;/em&gt;: Join attributes from a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the field in this layer&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: PID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the table to join&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: insustatus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the field in the table&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join Options&lt;/em&gt;: Keep all records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Validate Join. This is similar to the Verify button we saw in the Select By Attributes tool; it makes sure that all the right conditions are in place for the join operation to execute successfully.  When you become more comfertable with the workflow/system, this is something you may be tempted to skip, but unless you are &lt;strong&gt;sure&lt;/strong&gt; that the join will work, it&amp;rsquo;s usually best to just check.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are asked whether to create an index, click Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;attribute table&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;shomes&lt;/em&gt; layer. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Answer Question #11 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the rest of this handout to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;fill in Question #12 on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click on &lt;em&gt;shomes&lt;/em&gt; and select &lt;strong&gt;Selection | Select All&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write down the total number of surveyed homes in the table on the assignment sheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Use the *Statistics** tool or just look at the bottom of the attribute table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;Select By Attributes&lt;/strong&gt; to select the homes that were insured before the Loma Prieta earthquake: Using the PRELOMAINS attribute, 1 = Insured and 2 = Not insured. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this information down in the table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the same for homes that were insured after the earthquake (POSTLOMAIN).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear the selected features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-determine-the-distance-of-each-home-to-san-andreas-ssz&#34;&gt;2.  Determine the distance of each home to San Andreas SSZ&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;em&gt;shomes&lt;/em&gt; layer and select &lt;em&gt;Joins and Relates | Remove Join(s) | insustatus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click &lt;em&gt;shomes&lt;/em&gt; again and select &lt;em&gt;Joins and Relates | Join…&lt;/em&gt; and use the following parameters:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you want to join to this layer?&lt;/em&gt;: Join data from another layer based on spatial location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the layer to join to this layer&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: sszpoly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each point will be given all the attributes of the polygon that&lt;/em&gt;: is closest to it (Don’t press OK yet.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;open folder&lt;/strong&gt; icon and save the output &lt;em&gt;housepolysj.shp&lt;/em&gt; in your Part02 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you can click OK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;strong&gt;attribute table&lt;/strong&gt; of your new layer and notice the Distance attribute that was created. This tells you how many meters that particular point is away from the nearest polygon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select&lt;/strong&gt; all features in housepolysj and use &lt;strong&gt;Statistics&lt;/strong&gt; to find the average (mean) distance between the homes and San Andreas Special Study Zone (SSZ). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this down in the assignment sheet table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the &lt;em&gt;housepolysj&lt;/em&gt; layer and select &lt;strong&gt;Joins and Relates | Join…&lt;/strong&gt;. Use the following parameters:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What do you want to join to this layer?&lt;/em&gt;: Join attributes from a table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the field in this layer&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: PID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the table to join&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: insustatus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose the field in the table&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;: ID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Join Options&lt;/em&gt;: Keep all records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;Select By Attribute&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;housepolysj&lt;/em&gt; to determine the number of homes that are within 4 miles of San Andreas SSZ (1 mile = 1609.344 meters). &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this down in the table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the average distance to the San Andreas SSZ for the homes that are within 4 miles of San Andreas SSZ. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this down in the table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;em&gt;housepolysj&lt;/em&gt; attribute table, click the &lt;strong&gt;Table Options&lt;/strong&gt; button (upper left corner) and select &lt;strong&gt;Switch Selection&lt;/strong&gt;. This will invert your selection to (logically) select everything greater than 4 miles from the SSZ.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: There is also a button on the top of the mune that inverts your selection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the number of homes that are farther than 4 miles of San Andreas SSZ. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this down in the table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the average distance to the San Andreas SSZ for the homes that are farther than 4 miles of San Andreas SSZ. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this down in the table&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using similar steps as before to determine how many homes in the &lt;em&gt;housepolysj&lt;/em&gt; layer were insured before and after the earthquake. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Write this down in the table and then calculate the percentages for each catagory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit the answer sheet on blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lab 07 - Overlay &amp; site suitability analysis</title>
      <link>https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/lab07/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-objective&#34;&gt;Learning Objective&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lab will introduce the idea of overlay analysis in terms of a common application, site suitability.  Site suitability can take a number of forms but in this lab we&amp;rsquo;ll approach these concepts in vector and raster form.  You will also touch briefly on Terrain analysis, something we&amp;rsquo;ll see more of in the next lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1-attribute-spatial-queries&#34;&gt;Part 1: Attribute &amp;amp; Spatial Queries&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A logging company has been given a license to develop and to cut down trees in the Oakwood area (see the figure to the right). However, there are restrictions on where the company can cut down trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this exercise will be to select sites where the company can log. We will use the ArcGIS to select these sites according to the selection rules given below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;License Restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No trees may be cut down within 10km of the shrine, in order to preserve the aesthetic of the landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No trees may be cut down within 1km of the sea, the lake, or any river in order to help prevent land erosion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The logging sites must be within 5km of existing roads for easy access by heavy logging equipment, since conservation laws will not allow any new roads to be built in this area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-read-through-the-part-1-section&#34;&gt;1 Read through the Part 1 section&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point you should be able to discern how to accomplish what you want to accomplish.  We want to show the logging company where they can and cannot log.  As is the case with most things in life, &lt;em&gt;there are a few ways we can do this, and the choice is yours&lt;/em&gt; (if you got this, you are my new favorite student).  Below I walk you through one way to accomplish this, but you will gain far more if you design your own way to arrive at the same end goal.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/YourChoice_Socucius_Ergalla.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-data-organization&#34;&gt;2 Data Organization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start ArcMap, create a new empty map, and save your map document to your personal folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add forest.shp, rivers.shp, water.shp, roads.shp and shrine.shp, all of which are located in your Part01 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the data frame properties, change the display units to kilometers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrange the layers correctly

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure List By Drawing Order (upper left of the Table of Contents) is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrange the layers in this order (bottom to top): water, forest, roads, rivers, and shrine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the symbology of each layer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the rivers blue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the roads black.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the shrine red.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the water blue. This requires extra steps:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Symbology tab, click Categories near the upper left part of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Unique Values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select ISWATER as the Value Field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Add All Values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uncheck the box the left of &lt;all other values&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Value column, recall that water = 10 and everything else = 1, so double-click the color box next to 10 and change it to a blue color, and then click the color box next to 1 and change it to Hollow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember these steps, they will come in handy when making the final map for this analysis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make the forests green. There are two kinds of trees in this layer, so use a different shade of green for each kind. To do so, follow similar steps as were just performed for the water layer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-create-buffers-for-roads-rivers-and-shrine&#34;&gt;3 Create Buffers for Roads, Rivers, and Shrine&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox (the button with the little red box on it) go to Analysis Tools | Proximity | Buffer. Use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input Features: roads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Feature Class: roads_buffer.shp (make sure to save in your Part01 folder) Linear Unit: 5 km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissolve Type: All&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK and give it a minute to work. When it’s done it won’t look pretty, but we’ll change that later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the same steps to create 1 km buffer around the rivers layer and a 10 km buffer around the shrine layer. Make sure you give the output files descriptive names (e.g., rivers_buffer.shp and shrine_buffer.shp).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-create-sea-and-lake-buffers&#34;&gt;4 Create Sea and Lake Buffers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to select the sea and lake polygons from the water layer. If we were to just do this we would end up buffering both shapes in the layer.  Recall that when tools run, they typically operate within the active data frame, and use the current selection (or the whole shapefile if nothing is selected).  So to accomplish what we want to do, we want only the actual water from the water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do this, go to Select by Attributes… and use the expression &amp;ldquo;ISWATER&amp;rdquo; = 10.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you did with the other layers, create a 1 km buffer of the water features. (Note that if features are selected, the buffer tool will only create buffers for those selected features.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-finding-suitable-logging-sites&#34;&gt;5 Finding Suitable Logging Sites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we will find potential logging areas based on access to roads. In ArcToolbox go to Analysis Tools | Overlay | Intersect. Use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input: forest and roads_buffer (you will have to select each one individually)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Feature Class: Solution_1.shp (make sure to save in your Part01 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Attributes: All&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we will merge the rivers_buffers and Solution_1 layers. In ArcToolbox go to Analysis Tools | Overlay | Union. Use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input: Solution_1 and rivers_buffer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Feature Class: Temp_1.shp (make sure to save this in your Part01 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Attributes: All&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find those areas from Solution_1 that are not within the river exclusion zone (i.e., buffer), go to Select by Attributes…, select the Temp_1 layer, and apply the expression “FID_rivers” = -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Table of Contents, right-click the Temp_1 layer and select Data | Export Data….  Save the features as a shapefile called Solution_2.shp. Leave the other settings as they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When asked if you want to add the exported data as a layer, click Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Clear Selected Features button on the main menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox go to Analysis Tools | Overlay | Union. Use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input: Solution_2 and shrine_buffer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Feature Class: Temp_2.shp (make sure to save this in your Part01 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join Attributes: All&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To find those areas from Solution_2 that are not within the shrine exclusion zone (i.e., buffer), go to Select by Attributes…, select the Temp_2 layer, and apply the expression “FID_shrine” = -1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Table of Contents, right-click the Temp_2 layer and select Data | Export Data…. Save the features as a shapefile called Final.shp. Leave the other settings as they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Table of Contents, remove all layers that have names that start with Temp or Solution or that end with buffer. The following layers should remain: shrine, rivers, roads, Final, forest, and water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;6-create-a-map-and-export&#34;&gt;6 Create a map and export&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the map below as a rough guide, create a map that indicates which forest stands the company can legally log. Make sure your symbology is clear and that the crucial components of the map are not covered up by your Final layer. (Hint: Use patterns, and/or go to the Display tab of the layer’s Properties and change the transparency.) Use some creativity— don’t just copy the map below!  Export a PNG of the map and paste it in the answer sheet.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2&#34;&gt;Part 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part of the lab, we are interested in assessing how much of Douglas County is covered by tornado sirens. In other words, we want to know how many people can actually hear a tornado siren when it goes off. While the sirens for Douglas County were designed to be heard at distances of up to 5,800 feet, there might be areas in which people can’t hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-create-buffers&#34;&gt;1 Create Buffers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcMap, create a new empty map, and save your map document to your personal folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add countybnd.shp, roads.shp, censusblk.shp, and sirens.shp from your Part02 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create buffers around the sirens using the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input Features: sirens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output Features: sirens_buffer.shp (make sure to save in your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear Unit: 5800 feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissolve Type: All&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arrange layers so that you can see the siren points and buffers on top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-finding-the-percentage-of-population-covered-by-sirens&#34;&gt;2 Finding the Percentage of Population Covered by Sirens&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add kansas2000censusblk.dbf to the data frame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the censusblk layer, select Joins and Relates, and select Join. Join the layer to kansas2000censusblk.dbf using the STFID field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine the attribute table of censusblk to make sure the join was successful. Do you see all sorts of demographic attributes? If so, the join was successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the header of the POP2000 attribute and select Statistics. The sum value is the number of people in Douglas County. Record the value somewhere, as you will be entering this into the comments section of your Blackboard submission. Close the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Select by Location… to select the census blocks that are within the buffer zone.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Use the are completely within the source layer feature setting. The result should be 1,590 census blocks selected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the population in these census blocks by opening the censusblk attribute table, right- clicking the POP2000 attribute header, and selecting Statistics. (It will only give you statistics on the selected records.) Record this number.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the population out of the range of sirens by clicking Table Options (upper left corner of the attribute table), selecting Switch Selection, and then using the Statistics tool again. Record this number in yout answer sheet and answer the associated questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;Total Douglas County population:
Number of people who can hear the tornado sirens:
Number of people who cannot hear the tornado sirens:
Percentage of the population that can hear the tornado sirens:
Percentage of total population that cannot hear the tornado sirens:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Your math should add up.  If it doesn’t, reevaluate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switch the selection back (i.e., back to the blocks within range of the sirens) and close the attribute table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a screenshot of your entire screen and paste it in your answer document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-3-school-siting&#34;&gt;Part 3: School siting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have been asked to help a small town in Vermont find a suitable location to build a new school.  There are a few considerations to take into account, including the slope of the land surface, the distance to both recreation sites to existing schools, then reclassify these derived datasets to a common scale from 1-10. You will then set the model up to weight them according to a percentage influence and combine them to produce a map displaying suitable locations for the new school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-open-a-new-arcmap-and-setup&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Open a new ArcMap and setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I would normally say it is ok to create a new data frame and import the data, in this case we will set a few environmental variables, so for reproducibilities sake we will import data into a new map entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring in the data
&amp;gt; Hint: Getting a permissions error when you try to bring in the rasters?  Did you Google it?  &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.esri.com/thread/223412-invalid-raster-dataset-failed-to-create-raster-layer-permission-denied-how-can-i-overcome-this-problem:&#34;&gt;https://community.esri.com/thread/223412-invalid-raster-dataset-failed-to-create-raster-layer-permission-denied-how-can-i-overcome-this-problem:&lt;/a&gt; Think back to the data health page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on Geoprocessing &amp;gt; Environments:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the down arrows for the processing extent and set both the processing extent and the Snap Raster to elevation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Raster analysis section and set the cell size to the same as elevation.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-framing-the-work-flow&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Framing the work flow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town has asked you to identify some suitable areas in which to site a new school.  More explicitly, our site suitability analysis will concern itself with 4  factors.  We don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend a lot of money converting a land cover into a developable state.  We also don&amp;rsquo;t want to build on a particularly steep slope.  Because of the lack of a robust transit system, we want to place this school further away to maximize the accessibility of that school to the population.  We also want to place that school close to existing recreational sites.  Finally, we want to prioritize these factors in order of distance to a recreational facility &amp;gt; Distance to a school &amp;gt; Land use type = Slope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that, we have all the information we need to successfully execute this analysis, but it will be helpful if we frame what we want to accomplish in a visual sense.  ArcMap has a wonderful tool, Model builder, that provides an easy means of visualizing a GIS work flow.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/ExportGraphic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
Because these factors have different &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo;, we need to normalize them to some common scale.  Lets pick the easiest one, and make them a simple scale from 1-10, with 10 being the best.  The tool to do that is the reclassify tool.  The next sections will walk you through the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-land-cover-factor&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Land cover factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/LCExportGraphic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing we will do is reclassify the land cover.  Use the reclassify tool.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the input to the landuse raster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the LANDUSE field as the reclass field&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the values to those shown below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the folder icon next to the dialog box, create a new geodatabase in your part 3 folder, and save all subsequent rasters in there.  Call this Output raster LandC_R
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/LCR.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-slope-factor&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Slope factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SpExportGraphic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use the search function, there are a few ways we can calculate slope.  For this application we want but we want the slope tool from the Spatial Analyst toolbox.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the input raster to elevation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as Slope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leave the rest as defaults
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SlopeDia.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your map should look something like this:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SlopeM.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, we need to reclassify the slope to our common value range.  Use the reclassify tool again.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the input raster to Slope
Set the reclass field to value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the classify button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the classification method to Equal Interval, and the number of intervals to 10
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SlopeReclass.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the output SlopeR
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SlopeReclassDaig.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-school-distance-factor&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt; School distance factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SCExportGraphic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate distance we will use the Euclidian Distance tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the source features to Schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the output distance raster SchDis
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SchDisDiag.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we need to reclassify this raster, in comes the handy reclassify tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the input to SchDis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the reclass field to Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the same normalization as above (classify button &amp;gt; Equal Interval, intervals to 10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as SchDisR
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SchDisRDiag.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your final map after this step should look something like so:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SchDisRM.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;li-recreational-site-distance-factor&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt; Recreational site distance factor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/RCExportGraphic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to calculate the distance from our features again, re run the Euclidian Distance tool with the following settings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the source features to rec_sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the output distance raster recDis
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/RedDisDiag.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we need to reclassify this raster, in comes the handy reclassify tool again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the input to recDis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the reclass field to Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the same normalization as above (classify button &amp;gt; Equal Interval, intervals to 10)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output as RecDisR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because we want the area closer to the sites to have a higher value, we need to click the reverse New Values button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your final map after this step should look something like so:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/RecDisM.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;7-site-suitability-and-thresholding&#34;&gt;7 Site suitability and thresholding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/RasExportGraphic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of our standardized layers, we are ready to calculate our suitability raster.  Search for the Raster Calculator Tool (Spatial Analyst Tools)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an expression to weight each factor using the table below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the output SchSites
&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Layer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Weight&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;recR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;0.5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;schR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;0.25&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;landuseR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;0.125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;slopeR&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;0.125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the site suitability are displayed below.  Lets perform one last analysis, and find and highlight the areas with a site suitability score larger than 8.  Use the raster calculator tool with the following expression: &lt;em&gt;SchScore &amp;gt; 8&lt;/em&gt;, save the output as GoodSites.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/SchoolSite.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-what-to-submit&#34;&gt;8 What to submit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First let&amp;rsquo;s change the symbology of our map.Open the attribute table of the GoodSites raster and record the number of cells which meet our criteria.  Set the GoodSites symbology so that 1 is hollow, and 0 is gray.  Set the transparency of the layer to 50, making a poor mans mask of the interesting areas.  Turn off all layers other than GoodSites and ScSitesTake a screenshoot of the map, and record the number of cells and area rated as good fro school site development.  Submit the answer sheet to blackboard, you&amp;rsquo;re done!
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/GoodSiteMap.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-network-analysis&#34;&gt;Part 1: Network Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;
The part of the lab is designed to introduce some basic networking analyses, including how to setup a network dataset, how to find the efficient routes under different rules, and how to calculate the nearest facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/j610c377_home_ku_edu/EeekJKQUo05In6pweN4Eq04BItLXnRvfd73pA_0XFLF2Lg?e=5rbgEJ&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Data Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;SanFranciscoTran.gdb&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;Various transportation and government data about San Francisco&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Restricted Turns.lyr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Pre-defined layer of restricted turns along network&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-create-a-new-network-dataset&#34;&gt;1.  Create a new network dataset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few steps here where you can make a wrong turn (ba dum tss).  Read and follow them carefully, and take the time to read each window in Arcmap and think about what the different options might produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new data frame or start a new map document. Click Customize and select Extensions. Make sure the box next to Network Analyst is checked. Click Close.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Customize, select Toolbars, and click Network Analyst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the ArcCatalog button (looks like a little filing cabinet). Locate your Part1 folder in the Catalog Tree of the ArcCatalog window. Expand the folder (i.e., click the plus sign next to it) and expand the SanFranciscoTrans geodatabase. Right-click the Transportation feature dataset, select New, and click Network Dataset.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name the network dataset Streets_ND and then click Next. Click Next three more times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Field column in the Using Elevation Fields section, click F_ELEV and change it to T_ELEV. Click Next. Click Next again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the “Specify the attributes for the network dataset” page, click the Add button. Name the attribute RestrictedTurns, change the Usage Type to Restriction, and then click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the row you just created and then click Evaluators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Type column, change RestrictedTurns to Constant and change the Value column to Use Restriction. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Next through the rest of the prompts and then click Finish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Yes on the window that pops up. Give it a minute to run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Close on the errors window that pops up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Yes to add the network layer to the map&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting map should look like a chaotic mess of streets, junctions, signposts, etc.—but that’s OK for now.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/MessyNetwork.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the RestrictedTurns layer and select Properties. Click the Symbology tab. Click Import. Click the little folder icon, select the file Restricted Turns.lyr in your Part1 folder, and click Add. Click OK. Click OK again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the down arrow next to the Add Data button and select Add Basemap. Click Streets and then click Add. Give it a minute to load and say Yes if the program asks about hardware acceleration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-find-the-best-route&#34;&gt;2 Find the best route&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Network Analyst button on the Network Analyst toolbar and select New Route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off all layers except Route, Streets_ND, and Basemap. Zoom in close to downtown San Fran (the northeast tip of the peninsula). Notice how the colors indicate varying amounts of traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a screenshot of your entire screen and save it to your personal folder (that should look like this).
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/FirstZoom.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are now going to find the best route for a hypothetical shopping trip. Click the Find button (looks like a pair of binoculars). Click the Locations tab and Enter in the Single Line Input field:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;301 Post St., San Francisco, CA 94108&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Find. Right-click the first result listed and select Add as Network Analysis Object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the last two steps for the following addresses:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1405 Montgomery St., San Francisco, CA 94111&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;39 Pier 39 Concourse, San Francisco, CA 94133&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3301 Lyon St., San Francisco, CA 94123&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;301 Post St., San Francisco, CA 94108 (…in order to make it a round trip!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the Find window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click Route in the Table of Contents and in the Analysis Settings tab. Check the box next to Use Start Time. Change the Time of Day to 09:00 and the Day of Week to Monday. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Solve button (looks like a grid with a line through it) on the Network Analyst toolbar. Click the Directions button (right next to the Solve button). Scroll down to the bottom of the window. It should list the time and distance of the trip. Move the Directions window so that it and the route are both visible.  Take a screenshot of your entire screen and save it to your personal folder (this should look like so).
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/FinishedNetwork.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2-3d-in-gis&#34;&gt;Part 2: 3D in GIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives
This part of the lab will introduce you to the ArcScene environment of the 3D Analyst extension. First you will drape an image of Death Valley in ArcScene, and then you will explore the population of Douglas County using three dimensional symbology and Google Earth imagery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Esri’s ArcGIS Resource Center: “ArcScene is a 3D viewer that is well suited to generating perspective scenes that allow you to navigate and interact with your 3D feature and raster data. Based on OpenGL, ArcScene supports complex 3D line symbology and texture mapping as well as surface creation and display of TINs. All data is loaded into memory, which allows for relatively fast navigation, pan, and zoom functionality. Vector features are rendered as vectors, and raster data is either downsampled or configured into a fixed number of rows/columns you set.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}

    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Data Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;DVIM3.tif&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;Spaceborne radar imagery over Death Valley&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;dvtin&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) terrain model for portion of Death Valley&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Death Valley Terrain.lyr&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Layer file of Death Valley, for display purpose only&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Dougctyblks.shp&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Douglas county census block layer&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-draping-an-image-in-arcscene&#34;&gt;1 Draping an Image in ArcScene&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &lt;em&gt;ArcScene&lt;/em&gt;. Give it a minute to load. Click Cancel on the window that pops up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As you would in ArcMap, add the Death Valley Terrain.lyr from your Part2 folder. Also add DVIM3.TIF, The image is drawn on a plane with a base elevation of zero. Turn off the Death Valley Terrain layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click DVIM3.TIF and select Properties. In the Base Heights tab, click the Floating on a custom surface: radio button. Because the dvtin TIN (from which the layer file was created) is the only surface model in the scene, it appears in the dropdown list. Click OK and observe what happens to the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draping the radar image over the terrain surface allows you to see the relationship between the general shape of the land surface and the texture of the rocks and sediment that make up the surface.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore the image using the 3D tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click Scene layers (similar to ArcMap’s data frame) and select Scene Properties. Under the General tab, change the Vertical Exaggeration to 2. Click OK. Notice that the apparent height of the terrain is now doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click the familiar Full Extent button. Click the Set Observer button (it looks like a target with an eye in front of it). This tool allows you to click on a portion of the image to observe the landscape from that point of view. Use this tool to explore the different 3D views. (Beware that clicking on flat spots will point your view to the sky! If that happens, just click the Full Extent button.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select a view that you find particularly interesting. Take a screenshot of your entire screen and save it to your personal folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save your 3D ArcScene document to your Part2 folder as deathvalley.sxd.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/3DView.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-displaying-attribute-values-in-3d&#34;&gt;2 Displaying attribute values in 3D&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new ArcScene document.  Add dougctyblks.shp from your Part2 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s set the color symbology to reflect population values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Properties of the dougctyblks layer and click the Symbology tab. Click Quantities and select pop2k as your Value field. Increase the number of classes to 10. Click Apply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we will use extrusion to represent population. (According to Esri, extrusion is “the process of stretching a flat 2D shape vertically to create a 3D object.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Extrusion tab. Check the box to Extrude features in layer and then click on the adorable little calculator. The expression we wish to use here is simply [pop2k], so just double-click pop2k in the Fields box and then click OK. Click the Apply extrusion by: dropdown menu and select adding it to each feature’s base height. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should see the extrusions. Since we’ve used the same variable for color and extrusion height, this means the darker the color, the taller the extrusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we will make the layer translucent and load it into Google Earth. Open the Properties of the dougctyblks layer and click the Display tab. Set the transparency to 50%. Click OK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcToolbox and go to Conversion Tools&amp;gt;To KML&amp;gt;Layer to KML. Use the dropdown menu (not the little folder) to select dougctyblks as the input layer. Save the output as dougpop.kmz in your Part2 folder. Set your Layer Output Scale to 1. Click OK. Give the tool a minute to work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your 3D ArcScene document to your Part2 folder as dougpop.sxd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close ArcScene. In Windows Explorer, navigate to your Part2 folder and then double-click your dougpop.kmz file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open it in Google Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pan, zoom, and tilt in order to get a good look at the extruded layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Settle a cool view. Use save image, add the pieces and save it to your personal folder.

&lt;p&gt;Objectives
This section will introduce you to basic terrain analysis in the raster data model. You will learn how to:
1 Create contours, profiles, and hillshades
2 Derive slope and aspect
3 Generate a viewshed&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-generate-contours&#34;&gt;1 Generate contours&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcMap. Click Customize and select Extensions. Makes sure the Spatial Analyst extension is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add DEM30 and TRAIL.shp from your Part3 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Contour and use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input raster: DEM30 (select from the dropdown list)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output polyline features: (Save as contour in your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counter interval: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base contour: 400 Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the contour layer and select Label Features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drag the TRAIL layer to the top of the Table of Contents. Make the trail line thicker so that it’s easier to see. Right-click the layer and select Zoom To Layer. Look at the trail. Click Fixed Zoom Out a few times and look at the trail again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-create-hillshades-and-derive-slope-and-aspect&#34;&gt;2 Create hillshades and derive slope and aspect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the contour layer and click Full Extent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Hillshade. The input layer should be DEM30. Leave all the settings as their defaults and create an output file named hillshade in your Part3 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the last step but set the Z factor to 3 and save it as hillshade3z.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn this new hillshade on and off to see the difference between it and the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create another hillshade and set Altitude to 60, the Z factor to 3, and save it as hillshade3z60.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn this new hillshade on and off to see the difference between it and the original.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off all the hillshades.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Slope.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select DEM30 (from the drop-down menu) as the Input raster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the Output raster as slope. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Aspect. Select DEM30 (from the drop-down menu) as the Input raster. Save the Output raster as aspect. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend a moment looking at your slope and aspect rasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the slope and aspect layers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-create-trail-profile&#34;&gt;3 Create trail profile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Customize and select Extensions. Make sure 3D Analyst is checked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Customize, select Toolbars, and select 3D Analyst.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click TRAIL and select Zoom to Layer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the 3D Analyst toolbar, make sure your Layer is set to DEM30. Click the Interpolate Line button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you will trace the trail to digitize a line. Simply click once to start and then click again along the path to create vertices. There’s no need to be ultra-precise. Double-click once you have completed the line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the 3D Analyst toolbar, click the Profile Graph tool and select Profile Graph. (The line must be selected for this to work.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click on the title bar of the profile graph and select Properties. In the Appearance tab, change the Title to Trail Elevation Profile and the Footer to your name. Click Apply and OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a screenshot of the entire screen and save it to your personal folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the Profile Graph.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/ProfileGraph.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-create-a-line-of-sight&#34;&gt;4 Create a line-of-sight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the 3D Analyst toolbar, click the Create Line of Sight button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the dialog box that appears, type 1.7 as the Observer offset. (This will show what is visible from the perspective of an observer 1.7 meters [5’7”] tall.) Leave the Target offset as it is. Keep the dialog box open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom into an area of your choosing. Draw some lines by clicking once at a start point and clicking once at an end point.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The green segments of the line are visible from the observer point,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The red segments are not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The blue dot represents the “point of obstruction from the observer to the target.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close the line-of-sight dialog box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the lines-of-sight you created and delete them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-create-flattop-viewshed&#34;&gt;5 Create flattop viewshed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the FLATTOP.shp from your Part02 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the layer’s attribute table. Add two new fields, OFFSETA and RADIUS2, both with a Type of Float, a Precision of 8, and a scale of 2.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hint: Start with the Table Options button!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an edit session.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember this? Hint: Open the Editor toolbar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the attribute table of FLATTOP, enter 22.05 in the OFFSETA field and 8045 in the RADIUS2 field. Save your edits and end the edit session.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Viewshed. Use DEM30 as the Input raster, FLATTOP as the Input point, and save the output as viewshed in your Part02 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Full Extent to see your viewshed. Look at the Table of Contents to see which color corresponds to the visible sections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a screenshot of the entire screen and save it to your personal folder.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/geog358/media/Viewshed.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lab-submission&#34;&gt;Lab submission:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should submit your 5 screenshots to blackboard.  Congratulations, you are finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;part-1-temperature-modeling-and-interpolation&#34;&gt;Part 1: Temperature Modeling and Interpolation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This part will introduce you to the basic operations of cartographic modeling (or map algebra). We will be calculating temperature across the U.S. using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and building a simple fire hazard model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kansas-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/j610c377_home_ku_edu/Edmpgz1Od-BCrep6PSQTxRwBk0eauuB1BnQYui-d-fX9zQ?e=83fyJH&#34;&gt;Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Data Name&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;USDEM10K&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;DEM covering the conterminous US. &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;US_TEMP.shp&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Weather stations across conterminous&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;US. STAT48.shp&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;48 conterminous states in US.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-temperature-estimation-and-comparison&#34;&gt;1 Temperature estimation and comparison&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open ArcMap. Add US_TEMP.shp, STAT48.shp and USDEM10k grid (all in the Part01 folder) to the data frame. Ignore warnings about spatial information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The original DEM is recorded in feet. However, we need to convert it to meters. Open ArcToolbox and go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Map Algebra | Raster Calculator.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you get an error message about licensing, go to Customize | Extensions… and check the Spatial Analyst box.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double-click the “USDEM10K” layer, and then add * .3048 to the expression. (1 ft = 0.3048 m)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the Output raster in your Part01 folder as DEM_meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your new DEM will appear in your table of contents with values ranging from 0 to ~4,091.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stat48grid will be a raster representation of the polygon state48 shapefile. In ArcToolbox, go to Conversion Tools | To Raster | Feature to Raster. Use the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input features: STAT48&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Field: STAT48L&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output raster: (Save as Stat48grid in your Part01 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output cell size: 10000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-click the ArcToolbox node (the top of the ArcToolbox menu—scroll up if you can’t see it) and click Environments….&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click Workspace and set both the Current Workspace and the Scratch Workspace to your Part01 folder. (You may have to go up one level to get to the full path of your Part01 folder.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll down, click Raster Analysis, and set Mask to Stat48grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-using-global-lapse-rate-to-model-temperature&#34;&gt;2 Using Global Lapse Rate to Model Temperature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The airport in Columbia, South Carolina has an observed mean annual temperature of 17oC with an elevation of approximately 65 m.  The global lapse rate tells us that temperature decreases 6.5o C for every 1,000 m increase in elevation.  Let’s calculate the elevation and temperature difference in each raster cell from the Columbia Airport.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Map Algebra | Raster Calculator. To calculate the elevation difference from Columbia Airport, use the expression: “DEM_meters” – 65&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output in your Part01 folder as elev_diff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Raster Calculator again. To calculate the temperature difference from Columbia Airport based on the global lapse rate, use the expression: “elev_diff” * (6.5 / 1000)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output in your Part01 folder as temp_diff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, using the mean annual temperature at Columbia Airport (17o C) and the difference in temperature at each cell from this location (temp_diff), we will estimate the temperature across the U.S. In the Raster Calculator, use the expression: 17 – “temp_diff”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output in your Part01 folder as temp_model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-using-inverse-distance-weighting-to-interpolate-temperature&#34;&gt;3 Using Inverse Distance Weighting to Interpolate Temperature&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we’re going to interpolate a temperature grid from the US_TEMP shapefile using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method. In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Interpolation | IDW and use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input point features: US_TEMP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z value field: TEMPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output raster: (Save as temp_IDW in your Part01 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output cell size: 10000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power: 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The result is another version of temperature across the nation, but this time it’s based on interpolation between established weather stations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the Raster Calculator, calculate the temperature difference between estimated (based on global lapse) and interpolated temperature: “temp_model” – “temp_IDW”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output in your Part01 folder as temp_compare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save your map document as YourLastName_temp_model.mxd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a screenshot of the entire ArcMap window and save it to your personal folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-2-fire-hazard-modeling&#34;&gt;Part 2: Fire Hazard Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In areas of the United States where the population has expanded to rural and forested land covers, the risk of wildland fire is great. The term Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) is used to describe these areas. Special mitigation and response strategies have been developed to manage risk in these areas. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has developed a set of standards for evaluating risk in developing areas threatened by wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the lab presents a portion of a very simple wildfire risk model. It shows how to use GIS to model just two of the many factors that influence wildfire risk: slope and fuel. Together these two factors make up one of the criteria specified in the NFPA 299 Standards for Protection of Life and Property from Wildfire. (A more realistic model of wildfire risk would use complex data that would include a very detailed breakdown of the vegetation into fuel classes and would model both slope  and aspect. Additional data on weather history, the locations of structures, fire history, access, the evacuation routes available, and other factors that might affect fire ignition and spread would also be incorporated in the model.) You will convert digital elevation model (DEM) data and vector files  to raster data and assign a fire risk value and percentage of influence. Then you will create a model that will generate a map showing overall fire hazard risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}

    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;elevation.dem&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;Terrain surface (.dem format)&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;studyarea&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Extent of the fire risk model&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;vegetation&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Vegetation types in the study area&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-building-a-fire-hazard-model&#34;&gt;1 Building a fire hazard model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new ArcMap document (or new data frame) and add the vegetation and studyarea shapefiles from your Part02 folder. Ignore warnings about spatial reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the ArcToolbox node (the top of the ArcToolbox) and click Environments….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Workspace and set both the Current Workspace and the Scratch Workspace to your Part02 folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Processing Extent and change the Extent to Same as layer studyarea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Raster Analysis and set the Cell Size to Same as layer elevation.dem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Conversion Tools | To Raster | Feature to Raster and use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input features: vegetation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Field: VEGTYPE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output raster: (Save as &lt;strong&gt;Rveg&lt;/strong&gt; in your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output cell size: elev_raster (navigate to your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Slope and use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input raster: elevation.dem (again, navigate to your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output raster: (Save as slope in your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output measurement: PERCENT_RISE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Z factor: 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weighted linear combination (overlay) process combines slope and vegetation data to assess the overall fire hazard. Because these layers do not contain similar data, the values in each layer must be converted to a common value scale. The common scale for this model will assign a value of 1 to areas with the lowest wildfire potential and 3 to areas with the highest wildfire potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Reclass | Reclassify and use the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input raster: slope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclass field: VALUE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclassification:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Classify… to bring up the Classification window. Change the Classes to 3. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the table to reflect the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that you must use spaces in the Old values ranges (e.g., 0 – 30, not 0-30)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Old values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;New values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;0 - 30&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;30 - 60&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;60 - 300&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use this same tool (reclassify) to create a factor layer for vegetation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input raster: Rveg&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclass field: VEGTYPE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reclassification:&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change the table to reflect the following:
&lt;style type=&#34;text/css&#34;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#ccc;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#fff;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#ccc;color:#333;background-color:#f0f0f0;}
.tg .tg-0pky{border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-btxf{background-color:#f9f9f9;border-color:inherit;text-align:left;vertical-align:top}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;tg&#34;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Old values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;New values&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;Lodgepole pine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Engelmann spruce&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;Krummholz&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;non-forest&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;whitebark pine&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-btxf&#34;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;water&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;NoData&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;NoData&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;tg-0pky&#34;&gt;NoData&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output raster: (Save as vegfactor in your Part02 folder)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-linear-combination&#34;&gt;2 Linear Combination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the weighted linear combination process, weights are assigned to each factor based on the influence a factor has on the fire hazard assessment. In this model, slope is deemed a more important (0.75) factor than vegetation type (0.25).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Map Algebra | Raster Calculator and enter the following formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(0.75 * “slopefactor”) + (0.25 * “vegfactor”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the output in your Part02 folder as fire_hazard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click the ArcToolbox node (the top of the ArcToolbox) and click Environments….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Raster Analysis (you may have to scroll down to see it) and set Mask to studyarea. Click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In ArcToolbox, go to Spatial Analyst Tools | Surface | Hillshade and use the following settings:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input raster: elev_raster&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Output raster: (Save as hillshade in your Part02 folder)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate the highest fire risk spot in the study area by entering the following into Raster Calculator (Spatial Analyst Tools | Map Algebra | Raster Calculator): “fire_hazard” == 3 (The pixels that meet this qualification will get a value of 1 and all others will get a value of 0).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save the output in your Part02 folder as high_fire_haz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Table of Contents, move high_fire_haz on top of the hillshade to display the “hot spots” above the terrain surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the Properties of the high_fire_haz layer, click the Display tab, and set the transparency to 50%. Click OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turn all layers off, except the high_fire_haz and hillshade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a screenshot of the entire ArcMap window and save it to your personal folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upload both of your screenshots to Blackboard. There is nothing to hand in this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/dronemapping/YUN00120.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;drones-for-mapping-and-research&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drones for mapping and research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many reasons I gravitated towards the Environmental Sciences, but perhaps the single largest factor was the practicality of the problem.  While we could devise any number of conceptual models for the world while in the lab, at the end of the day if we wanted to know how things worked in the “real” world all we had to do was go outside and observe.  However, as both my understanding of the world and our technical abilities increased, I became increasingly interested in how to best represent earth system processes, and our uncertainties in them, within a digital environment.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/dronemapping/KS_Lawrence West_511813_1950_24000_tn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When most think of how we represent landforms, there are two basic formats with which they conjure.  You might recall old USGS contour maps, showing the terrain and prominent land cover features.  If you’re more technically oriented, you might imagine a view of the world though Google Earth Engine.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/dronemapping/GISData.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These representations are perfect for conveying the basic geographic context of an area, but if you want to go further than that, we have to turn towards a more advanced means of representing reality.  Enter the world of airborne observations.  Lidar surveys are the newest state of the art means of collecting large areas of high-resolution elevation data.  More commonly known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep&#34;&gt;3DEP&lt;/a&gt;, this effort seeks to provide complete and high accuracy coverage across CONUS (Contiguous United States).  This used to be the state of the art, and should be completed by 2023
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/dronemapping/FY19_Partnerships_territories_08212019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
As is usually the case though, it’s never good enough.  Depending on the location and use case, imagery is hard to come by or outdated for the use case.  In these instances, small Unmanned Aerial Systems, more commonly known as drones, offer a unique solution to some of these shortcomings.  Using commercially available hardware and cutting edge software, we are able to fly over an area and collect imagery which we use to create our own custom point clouds and 3D models.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/dronemapping/OreadOrthoTrimmedSmaller.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://jimcoll.github.io/courses/dronemapping/YUN00016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
As a critical part of my dissertation, I am interested in flying areas to determine what factors go into an effective terrestrial mapping effort.  If you have an area you would like flown, particularly if it has interesting and complex geometry or if it’s near a body of water, please contact me and we can see what we can work out.&lt;/p&gt;
